0:00,Alexandra Minna Stern and Natalie Lira,The movement that inspired the Holocaust,Mar 2022,"As a new widow, Sarah Rosas Garcia was already struggling to support her nine children when her oldest daughter  was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible  for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place  in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement  dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist  Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists  included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits were passed down. However, their definition of what traits  were and were not desirable was largely determined  by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people  were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard  reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called “racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign  systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men,  and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden,  Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization  of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws  that mandated sterilization for men and women  deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based  on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were  59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands  of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued  that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights  to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible  Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims  of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research  into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun  to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued  to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest marches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws  were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization  of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe."
21:33,Anna Malaika Tubbs,The critical role of Black mothers — and how to support all moms,Mar 2022,"Anna Malaika Tubbs: ""The Three Mothers"" is about Alberta King, Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little, the mothers of MLK Jr., James Baldwin and Malcolm X. And I wrote this book to not only celebrate these three incredible life stories that we should have known for years and years before my book, but to also think about what their stories could symbolize for Black women, Black mothers, mothers more generally, and what it could mean to save their stories from being forgotten, from being erased, and how it changes our understanding of where we are as a nation today, how we have arrived here, what are changes that we still need to make. Whitney Pennington Rogers: That's great. I think in reading it, you can feel how really lovingly you put all of this together and did this research and the attention that you put to this, this really comes through in the finished product. Well, we have we have a question from Jeff. Jeff says that, ""As a father, this talk changed my life. I bought the book, a few copies, and was in the audience in December live, and it generated this concern for me. How much history was impacted with lack of mother's input, especially Black mothers?” And that's the question. AMT: Oh, it's a big question. First, thank you, Jeff, I really appreciate that. So much of our history, we are missing these stories. And the feeling that you felt in being in that audience and that I felt in uncovering these stories and every piece of the puzzle that I found just really shocked me, that we didn't know these things already and infuriated me. And it really caused me some deep sadness, because I realized how many more stories are -- I mean, we're missing so many, and of course, not everybody is going to be famous and not everyone’s going to have a book written about them. But it's very, very unique, this erasure of Black women's contributions. It is very intentional. Like I said, with ""Hidden Figures"" as an example, why would we not know that Black women were the mathematicians called ""the computers"" behind a space launch? That is critical information for our history. And for me to think as a young Black woman, when I was sitting in school, when I was a young Black girl, what that could have meant to me to know that. That it was a part not only of -- I could not be the first Black woman to do something, but that there was a history before me of Black female mathematicians and these brilliant brains. And even as much as, you know, my parents educated me on my Black history and my African history because even I have a privilege that many Black Americans do not have. I knew my connection to my lineage in Ghana, etc. So much of this history has been robbed from us. And it's a very strategic robbing. It's not a mistake. So that, just thinking from that perspective, we want to continue to uncover more and more stories of those who have been intentionally marginalized, intentionally oppressed. Because the more we can correct our telling of that story and that history, the better we'll do moving forward. So these attacks on telling history right now, it's very strategic. It’s not, again, a mistake. It's not something that people are doing unconsciously. It’s very: “We don’t want to tell the truth.” And we all need to reckon with that, and we need to fight against that. WPR: I think that it's really interesting in the book that you draw these parallels between what was happening in the lives of these three women and what we're seeing happening, you know, play out in the news today or have seen happen at other moments in history during their lives. And you know, I'm curious to hear how you think writing this book changed your perspective on the experiences of mothers currently, just how you think about motherhood today. AMT: Yeah, this is something that I already knew was an issue. Going back to my mom, she would always say, in every place that we travel to pay attention to how women are being treated in the society, how mothers, very specifically, are being treated. That is an indicator on how successful this community will be. And so I always carry that in the back of my mind, I was always aware that, when I moved back to the US, for instance, that we weren’t really giving mothers the support that they deserved; we certainly weren’t giving them the celebration that they deserve, and therefore the support was lacking. And there was this lack of understanding around the critical importance of the role. But in putting this book out there, and even doing the TED Talk and speaking to so many different audiences around this, it is a dire situation for mothers. And whether that's on a personal level, where those who have come up to me and said, “I am the mom who feels unappreciated in my household right now.” “I am the mom who feels unseen.” To this national level of a crisis where we are fighting for weeks of parental leave, mere weeks. This is ... It’s upsetting, and we should be embarrassed by that. These are things that should have been established by now, and I really do -- and I say this in the TED Talk -- I truly hope that within my lifetime, we can usher in a shift that starts with first saying: “Mothers are essential.” We need mothers to be supported because they are holding so much of our lives together, our society together. Stay-at-home moms are performing some of the most important work in our country, and we are devaluing them. And not only that, we are making them feel bad about what they are doing. This really is an issue that more of us need to take on. Going back to that very first question, why this is an issue for everybody to care about. And it sounds obvious, but we shouldn't have to say that if mothers are dying in a maternal health crisis -- one that is exacerbated for Black women -- the Black maternal health crisis is alarming, but generally the maternal health crisis in the US is terrible. It shouldn't be this way. Mothers of all races are dying more than they should be. We need to pay attention to that. That's not only bad for mothers, obviously. It's not only bad for mothers if they have to walk away from their job during the pandemic because there were no supports in place to catch them. It's not only bad for mothers if they have to choose between being a mother or making money for their family. That shouldn't be put on their shoulders. There should be supports in place. We should have affordable child care. We should have universal preschool. All of these things that impact mothers have ripple effects for the rest of us. So, yes, it opened my eyes to just how alarming and how critical a situation we're currently in. Even though, again, my mom raised me to know all of these things. Through doing this work, I’ve just now been kind of awoken to the need for people to open their eyes right now. WPR: M. Watson has a question that actually kind of piggybacks on this more than just thinking about how we can gain access to these stories, they want to know, you know, what do you feel is the most effective way we can, as a people, change the narrative around Black women? You know, if you have any specific examples which I know you share some in your talk, They ask, ""How can I personally be involved in this work of changing this narrative?"" AMT: Great question, and there are levels to this. I would say definitely understanding the history of how Black women have been treated is very important. So again, it's a shameless plug, but read the book. I talk about not only these three women, but again many of the goals that I had, one of them also was to explain tropes like the mammy and the matriarch trope and the Jezebel trope and the ""welfare queen"" and the strong Black woman trope. What all of these have meant in American history and what their intention was. And that is to say that anything Black women were dealing with was their own fault. That, with the mammy trope, that we didn't deserve necessarily to be compensated for work that we were doing, that we deserved to stay within domestic work and that we shouldn't necessarily be paid what that work was worth because we liked it and we were happy to be the mammy. The Aunt Jemima, who was smiling and wanted to do, you know, wanted to serve her white family more than her own. The matriarch trope that Black families have been separated from each other, not because of systems that have made it so that -- you know, mass incarceration or so many other things that I can mention, but instead because Black women were emasculating their men. Or the Jezebel trope that justified sexual violence against Black women because that's what Black women wanted, they were more promiscuous. Even the ""welfare queen,"" saying Black women are having children just to make money. So you have to understand this is a very long, ugly, painful history that we are dealing with as Black women day in and day out. And when people don’t get that those are the burdens we are holding, years and centuries of being told that everything that's happening to you, the pain you're going through, is because of you and not because of policies we've voted for or the ways in which we kept you from being elected or even being able to run for office or even vote. That's where it really begins. Take the time as much as you can to know how we've gotten to where it is right now and then to really have a moment where you fully appreciate the incredible resistance of Black women and the ways in which we've continued to create life, despite the ways that people have tried to rob it from us. And the vision behind what Black women have been able to accomplish, what they have imagined for this world because we can't accept the situation as it is right now because that dehumanize us. But we have pushed this nation forward to our vision in incredible ways. It's not only Stacey Abrams in Georgia, it's a long, long history of Black women saying, ""We don't agree with the system as it is now. So here is how we're going to help you see the world and the possibilities from our perspective."" And you look at American history from that angle, and it is powerful. There is nothing like it. And therefore, you better understand why we should elect more Black women, why we should vote for them to help usher our country and continue to do it. But with even more support and even more backing, because without that backing, without that support, when Black women have been erased and misrecognized, misrepresented, we have still created incredible change. So now we're asking that we be heard, we be listened to, and that our energy no longer be spent on explaining how we got here, but instead on how we can do whatever is next and whatever is possible. So it’s kind of a combination of try to learn our history, support us as leaders, put those tools in our hands as much as possible. Trust us, hear us, believe us, and also stop wasting our time on the need to explain the extra when that's work that we can do on our own. That kind of brings me full circle to my research being around I didn't reach out to the family until I'd done my part. So, yeah, I mean, even attending a conversation like this is part of doing your part, so kudos to you all. We're all real starting today. WPR: And that's doing your part to sort to educate yourself on information that already exists out there, it sounds like. Beyond what we could do individually to educate ourselves and make change in this space, what can we expect from our government to do more on the national scale and even thinking globally? What are some things that you would like to see so that we change the way that we, as a culture, think about Black motherhood? AMT: For this one, because I'll give it quicker answer than I have in me, because you can tell I like to talk, and I can go for a long time. But in the book, the concluding chapter is entirely about what we need to do as a world and what are the lessons that Alberta, Berdis and Louise’s lives are teaching us about our next steps forward when it comes to policy, when it comes to -- actually even kind of the three-level layer that I like to talk about, which is the interpersonal level, is an important one. The conversations that we're having with each other and the stories that we're telling, when I, you know, in the TED Talk, a little snippet, where we have mothers who feel like they have to be selfless and that we celebrate mothers for being selfless. So even around Mother's Day, we say to moms, ""Thank you for sacrificing everything for me and for putting yourself behind everybody."" And yes, a lot of mothers have done that, and certainly if they have, we should thank them for that. But what we can start to do is shift that story and that thank you, and say, ""Thank you for doing everything you could do for us. And also thank you for still seeing yourself as a human being"" or ""for representing yourself as a human with a full range of emotions, and for teaching me about my first life lessons, for being my first caretaker, for being my first leader, for being my first teacher."" Those are things that I think more accurately represent mothering in a way that is sustainable for mothers. Where mothers aren't going to burn out, where we're not putting all of it on moms and then reiterating it by saying, ""Thank you for putting yourself behind everyone else."" So that's on like an interpersonal level. I do think those conversations can make a huge difference in terms of what mothers are even thinking is the goal of what we're trying to achieve and what we want to be thanked for. The second level of that is, you know, in relationships, even beyond our households ... And I mean, like you said, in terms of Black motherhood, very specifically, this burden of putting our needs behind everyone, I just did a piece for “New York” magazine on this that that is further exacerbated for Black women because we have been seen as ""the mothers"" of a movement. We're always like mothers of something much larger and not just, like, mothers of our own children, but this weight of what's placed upon us. And specifically in this article, I'm focusing on mothers whose children have been killed, whether by police officers or neighborhood vigilantes, and how in these moments, instead of giving these moms the space to grieve, we're asking them to do something for our entire country. You know, we ask them to speak to crowds, they run for office, which can be a part of their personal healing as well, but we interpret that as, look at what this Black woman is doing for all of us, rather than us thinking about what is she going to do for her own healing, for her own restoration? So, that's kind of the extra layer to that. And then thinking about it on a national level, what we're voting for, I think about what could have helped Alberta, Berdis and Louise and what we still need to this day right now. So to give a little bit more information on the women. Alberta King had to walk away from her job because the law stated at the time that married women were not allowed to teach, and she'd always had this dream of being an educator. She had a bachelor's degree, she had a teaching certificate, but when she met her husband, she made the decision to start a family because this was like, she had to make a decision. And even though that law, the marriage bar is not in place now, what are the many ways in which we're pushing women and mothers out of their jobs? There are many that still exist, and we need to start addressing those. These are just one example from each woman. If we look at Berdis Baldwin, she was the victim of an abusive husband for years, years and years. And James Baldwin speaks about this often how abusive his stepfather was. But she didn't have anyone she could really turn to because, especially in Black communities, we are so afraid of what might happen if we call a police officer and we have multiple examples of this where we really needed help and intervention and then somebody ends up being shot when they're called, when police officers are called to protect us. So Berdis Baldwin was aware of this. Her children had been harassed by police officers. James Baldwin tells a story of when he was pushed into an alley and he was maybe 11 years old and police officers searched him, they were looking for someone, and just left him there on his own, this little boy. So she's not going to call them to help her in this situation. So she just endures this abuse all on her own. So what are systems we can think about in terms of should there be other people we can call who are not police officers? Should there be, you know, more support even for social workers that could come out? That's something to think about and to reflect on. And then as an example for Louise Little, I mean, all three of them have these different painful traumas that they experience. And for Louise, one of the major ones is that she is put in an institution against her will for 25 years of her life because she was this activist, radical activist, who spoke up against white supremacy, who stands and faces-off with the KKK, literally. And a white male physician was sent to her house to evaluate her after her husband had been murdered. And he concludes that she's experiencing dementia. And in his doctor's note, he says that she is, quote, ""imagining being discriminated against."" ""Imagining being discriminated against"" as a Black woman, Black immigrant woman living in the Midwest, and that is enough to put her away in an institution against her will. So in terms of us thinking about the biases that Black women are facing when they don't ask for help, even, and people just decide they're going to come in and evaluate them, especially even when they do, that they're going to be misunderstood, that they're going to be told they're imagining things, these are things we need to address. So we also have to do an evaluation of our health care systems and the biases that still exist. So it's kind of like this endless list, and I definitely don't want to end on such a heavy and hard note. But in that concluding chapter, it's called ""Our Lives Will Not Be Erased,"" that's where I go with it, is policy, and what we can do. Kind of, some tangible next steps. WPR: Well, I think that's so important and so valuable. And to your point of not ending in such a heavy place, you know, I guess, how do you feel, though, about the progress we are making? M. Watson asks, do you feel that the Black women narrative is progressing? AMT: I am an optimist, and I often say that my optimism lies in this incredible activism that Black women have held for so long and we continue to envision new realities for this world. And that makes me really hopeful. To study Alberta, Berdis and Louise, who again, it's not ancient history. Berdis passed away in 1999, Louise passed away in 1991. So this isn't like ancient ancient history, but they did face a lot of things that I no longer face as a result of their work and a result of what they were able to accomplish and how they taught their children to accomplish these things and change the world. So I'm not the kind of person who thinks we are stuck and there is no forward progress that we've made. I feel like that would be really disrespectful to them if I felt that way because they gave as much as they could to that progression, and it's my turn to carry that forward as well. But what I do hope is that more people join us in this and that Black women are not continuing to have to do this on our own. That more people will be aware of history, I sound like a broken record, but be aware of history so that we can move forward and fight anything that tries to keep us from telling accurate and full representations of our country's history. Because I think if we're aware of it, then we won't want to repeat it. And we have more people who will want to be allies in this fight. And in my contribution to this, I'm just hoping I'm giving more of us tools to join the conversation and think about how we can carry it forward.

0:00,Kevin Ehrman-Solberg and Kirsten Delegard,The dark history of the suburbs,Mar 2022,"On October 21st, 1909, 125 residents  of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood approached William Simpson, who’d just bought a plot in the area, and told him to leave. The Simpsons would be the second  Black family in the otherwise white neighborhood,   where they intended to build a home. When the Simpsons refused offers  to buy them out, their neighbors tried blocking their home’s construction. They finally moved into their house,  but the incident had a ripple effect. Just a few months  after the mob harassed the Simpsons, the first racially restrictive covenant was put into place in Minneapolis. Covenants are agreements in property deeds that are intended to regulate how the property is to be used. Beginning in the mid-1800s, people in the United States and elsewhere began employing them in a new way: specifically,  to racially restrict properties. They wrote clauses into deeds that were  meant to prevent  all future owners from selling or leasing  to certain racial and ethnic groups, especially Black people. Between 1920 and 1950, these racial covenants spread like wildfire throughout the US, making cities more segregated  and the suburbs more restricted. In the county encompassing Minneapolis, racial covenants eventually appeared  on the deeds to more than 25,000 homes. Not only was this legal, but the US Federal Housing Administration promoted racial covenants  in their underwriting manual. While constructing new homes, real estate developers began racially restricting them from the outset. Developments were planned as dream communities for American families— but for white people only. In 1947, one company began building what became widely recognized as the prototype of the postwar American suburb: Levittown, New York. It was a community  of more than 17,000 identical homes. They cost around $7,000 each  and were intended to be affordable for returning World War II veterans. But, according to Levittown’s  racial covenants, none of the houses could “be used or occupied by any person  other than members of the Caucasian race,” with one exception: servants. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of the American suburbs nearly doubled as white people flocked  to more racially homogenous areas in a phenomenon known as “white flight.” The suburbs spread, replacing native ecosystems with miles of pavement and water-guzzling lawns. And their diffuse layout necessitated car travel. American automobile production quadrupled between 1946 and 1955, cementing the nation's dependence on cars. Federal programs like the G.I. Bill offered American veterans favorable lending rates for buying homes. But it was difficult for people of color to take advantage of such resources. Racial covenants restricted them from certain neighborhoods. And, at the same time, government programs labelled neighborhoods of color bad investments and often refused to insure mortgages in those areas. Therefore, banks usually wouldn’t lend money to people purchasing property in neighborhoods of color— a practice that became known as redlining. So, instead of owning homes  that increased in value over time, creating wealth that could be passed to future generations, many people of color were forced to spend their income on rent. And even when they were<i> </i>able  to buy property, their home’s value was less likely to increase. The suburbs boasted cul-de-sacs  and dead ends that minimized traffic. Meanwhile, city planners often identified redlined neighborhoods as inexpensive areas  for industrial development. So, the massive freeway projects  of the mid-20th century disproportionately cut  through redlined neighborhoods, accompanied by heavy industry and pollution. As a result, many neighborhoods of color experience higher rates of drinking water contamination, asthma, and other health issues. People targeted by racial covenants increasingly challenged them in court and, in 1968, they were finally banned under the Fair Housing Act. But the damage had been done. Racial covenants concentrated wealth and amenities in white neighborhoods and depressed the conditions  and home values in neighborhoods of color. As of 2020, about 74% of white families  in the US owned their homes, while about 44% of Black families did. That gap is greatest  in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. Across the country, neighborhoods remain segregated and 90% of all suburban counties are predominantly white. Some landlords, real estate agents, and lenders still discriminate against people  based on race— rejecting them, steering them to and away  from certain neighborhoods, or providing inaccessibly high interest rates. Gentrification and exclusionary  zoning practices also still displace and keep people of color out of certain neighborhoods. Racial covenants are now illegal. But they can still be seen on many housing deeds. The legacy of racial covenants is etched across the pristine lawns of the American suburbs. It’s a footnote in the demographic divides of every city. And it’s one of the insidious architects of the hidden inequalities that shape our world."
0:00,Alex Gendler,Building the impossible: Golden Gate Bridge,Feb 2022,"In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires towered above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support California’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently in Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled, packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers  across a continent was just one of the challenges  facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began,  the pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge  would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve the area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought the project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home  to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone  San Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced  the bridge could be built; and that it would provide  San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait used a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists  of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers, linked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach: the suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck from cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds  and shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used  for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s,  advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire  to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest  suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible due to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size  could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components to California, reassembling the towers on site  didn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable, shallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower  essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor, creating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts between tides. The towers had so many compartments that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously, requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net  below the towers. But not even these precautions  could prevent an entire scaffolding platform from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete,  workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals, and laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished, but there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been  coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge  a tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow  actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s  natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch  to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color  still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills,  and rolling fog."
0:00,Sydney Iaukea,The dark history of the overthrow of Hawaii,Feb 2022,"It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door, arrested her, and led her to the room where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house,  claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power, building businesses and claiming arable land  that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility  closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries  to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii  as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business  opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants shifted positions. They formed a political group  known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii, bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua,  ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign, the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king  to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians  of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very  persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats  and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom  had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change,  she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it,  the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted  of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense  that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety”  removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading,  “Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government” declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed  that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year,  some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani  sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne, and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs  expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed  under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year,  the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii  as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared  it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights,  and national liberation. When she died in 1917,  these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced  Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have  peace and annexation the first thing to do  is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children, Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give the last drop of my blood.”"
0:00,Dwan Reece,The origins of blackface and Black stereotypes,Feb 2022,"When I was 10 years old, we traveled from Colorado to New Jersey to visit relatives at Christmas time. We did a host of a variety of things. I actually got to see the original cast in ""The Wiz"" and did a lot of sightseeing. But one of my favorite moments was to stay up late at night and wait till everyone else had gone to bed, and then I would sneak downstairs to watch television. A host of old movies that I probably had no business watching, such as ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Oklahoma,"" that was a little OK. But I remember one evening coming across a show. It was an old movie, and it must have been ""White Christmas"" or “Holiday Inn” or that type. But it was a musical. And I started watching, and then they started to do this musical scene, and I noticed I saw Bing Crosby in blackface. And I was confused. I couldn't quite understand what the blackface had to do with the singing and dancing. That was my introduction to blackface minstrelsy. Blackface minstrelsy originated in New York, and not the South as a lot of people would think, in the 1830s. It was an incident where white actors would blacken their faces with burnt cork, paint on bright red lips, exaggerate the whites of their eyes and put on a tightly coiled wig to create caricatures of African Americans on the American stage. The typical minstrel show was a parody of Black culture, song and dance and speech, interspersed with stump speeches, jokes, musical interludes and theatrical skits. The cast included a roster of recurring characters. The interlocutor acted as the emcee. You had Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones as the end men. Then you also had characters like the clownish slave Jim Crow, which was also the name of the Jim Crow laws that we knew in the American South. Or the maternal mammy, a hypersexualized wench; an arrogant dandy, Zip Coon; and the lazy, childish Sambo. The caricatures were often brutal, but not to the white audiences who laughed at the antics of the illiterate slaves as they sat secure in their own superiority. The image of the dancing, simple-minded buffoons captured the public's imagination and spread across the country like wildfire. Blackface minstrelsy grew to be the most popular form of American entertainment in the 19th century. Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain spoke highly of the American minstrel show, applauding the characterizations and the source of its humor. But just as it entertained, it also dehumanized the subjects of its ridicule, leaving the abolitionist Frederick Douglass to describe blackface minstrels as “the filthy scum of white society who have stolen from us a complexion denied them by nature."" Ironically, after the Civil War, African Americans forged their own careers on the professional stage. The route to success often meant appropriating the mask that was used to mock them. White audiences also embraced Black performance in their local communities. These amateur minstrels used instructional guides that provided them with jokes, routines, songs and costumes they needed to put on their own shows. Such was the habit of politicians, fraternal orders, colleges, high schools and community performances, who carried on this tradition well into the 20th century. The professional minstrel show left an indelible imprint on the American psyche. The images and racial stereotypes that continue to circulate in American society on sheet music, magazines, books, vaudeville, theater, film, television, radio, records and all kinds of formats. These stereotypes were a powerful reinforcement of the ideas of white supremacy and Black inferiority. The news headlines of the last few months have shown us that the legacy of blackface minstrelsy continues to haunt us. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, they found that one in three Americans say that blackface is always or sometimes OK if it's used in a Halloween costume. So let me ask this question. What is the appeal of darkening one's skin in order to impersonate someone of a different race? Blackface minstrelsy was born out of the realities of slavery and racial segregation, and its continual reappearance echoes the pain and suffering felt by Black people whose bodies and cultures were presented as strange and grotesque. It is a persistent reminder of the racism and prejudices that bred its very existence. The way it infiltrated society is a clear example of how deeply ingrained racism is in this country. And the racial subjugation embodied by blackface minstrelsy -- and perpetuated through a continuum of its history -- is a form of aggression, a psychic wound that refuses to heal. Racial impersonation of any form cannot escape this legacy. So it's time to shift the power of representation, to develop more expansive narratives about the rich complexity of who we are as human beings. Acknowledging and recognizing blackface for what it is and what it symbolizes is a step in the right direction. Educating ourselves on how stereotypes reinforce racist ideologies is another. Success in either case depends on an honest self assessment of our social and cultural biases and how they came to be. The legacy of blackface minstrelsy is our shared history and requires all of us to take collective responsibility in dismantling its power to oppress and humiliate. The next time you're confronted with someone in blackface or see a racist stereotype, tell me: What will you do? Thank you. (Applause)"
16:12,Nick Turner and Whitney Pennington Rodgers,How to fix two of the most broken systems in the US,Feb 2022,"Whitney Pennington-Rodgers: Hi, Nick,  thanks so much for being here. Nick Turner: Whitney, thank you. WPR: For those who aren’t familiar, could you start by just telling us a little bit about Vera and the work you do? NT: The Vera Institute of Justice is a leading justice reform organization. We seek to transform the criminal legal system and the immigration system. We call it the criminal legal system because to call it a criminal justice system is a little bit of a misnomer. It doesn't deliver justice. And we work to transform the immigration system because many of the problems that we see in the criminal legal system are just the same in the immigration system. And by transform, what I mean is to shrink both of those systems to make sure that they are less brutal than they are right now and that there's some modicum of justice that's provided. We work on some of the biggest problems that are facing the country in these two realms and try to provide solutions. So I'll just give you an example of that. One of the things that we did over the last years was to participate in a campaign that ended up overturning the congressionally imposed ban on Pell Grants, which is federal financial aid for low-income students. 1994, Congress said that those were no longer going to be available to incarcerated students, and we were able to win that back at the end of 2020. And that makes a remarkable difference to close to 20,000 people right now who have an opportunity to earn a degree, find a pathway to employment, to higher income, to end intergenerational incarceration, and for people who are concerned about it to save money because there's less recidivism. WPR: I know you do so much more than just that, but I mean, even thinking about the reason we need this sort of thing in this country and sort of how our justice system ended up in this space where this sort of work is even necessary. Maybe you could describe a little bit about that and how it plays into the rest of the world. NT: Well, there's a little bit of history to tell. I'm not a historian, but I think it's probably something that all of you are familiar with. This system that we have and the roots of it, they go down to our very bones. I often describe it as being just as American as apple pie. The system of mass incarceration that we have is just the latest iteration, the modern iteration of a system of racial subordination in the country. And it manifests and has manifested in different ways in America. But you can go back to slavery, you can go back to the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery except for people who were convicted criminally. You can think about  post-Reconstruction era, 1877 on, when the South, which didn't have a work force because it was deprived of enslaved people, passed laws, Black Codes, that made criminal things like standing on a corner, standing on a street, called it loitering. And then people would be arrested, and then their bodies would be sold to private industry and leased as labor. So that was our first interaction with mass incarceration in the country. And if you flash forward 100 years and you re-begin the story in the early 1970s, that was our second post-Reconstruction period where, in response to the gains that were made in the civil rights movement, politicians sought to tap into the frustrations of many white voters so that you talk about it sometimes as the Southern Strategy, and started responding to disorder that was seen in cities and said, ""We need to have a war on drugs."" ""We need to have a war on crime."" And generation of tough-on-crime laws, mandatory minimums were put in place. And that's what we have now. And we went on a sort of stratospheric, 700-percent increase in the prison population over the course of the 50 years between the early '70s and the aughts. And here's the thing that we should know, is that we did it. This is a product of democracy. It did not have to be this way, but we elected people who promised us that safety and order could be delivered by a criminal legal system that we have today. WPR: Well, thank you for that. I think it's interesting in thinking about this moment right now where I feel like there's so much interest in this subject and thinking about justice reform and and how we can fix this system. And I'm curious to know from you, sort of, your thoughts about this moment right now, where it is in some ways kind of trendy to support issues around criminal justice. NT: I've been doing this work for about 25 years, one way or another, in direct services at first and then in the policy work that Vera does and you know, I admit that I have seen in the past five or six years that this has become sort of a cause célèbre and people have gotten excited about it. I think that that is a fundamentally good thing. If you remember what I said a moment ago, that this is democracy that created this monster that we have, and so the only way that we will undo it is if people engage. And so the mere fact that we have discussions like the one that we're having tonight, that you can name a slew of celebrities from Kim Kardashian to, you know, to John Legend, and sort of, list goes on who have elevated this issue and made people start to think about it differently, that we have a generation of young people who have grown up with the concept of mass incarceration and understand it's actually not something that is necessary to deliver safety, but in fact that there are all sorts of profound costs and burdens that are associated with it. So it may feel trendy because for, you know, up until five or six years ago, while many people carried the stigma and the sadness that one in two Americans have a family member who has been incarcerated -- that's massive, one in two. This is what we've created, and a lot of people carry that stigma and so that people are finally talking about it and calling attention to it is absolutely necessary. So I'm OK if people are on trend. WPR: And I'm curious if you feel the pandemic in any way has impacted your work or the way that we all should be thinking about justice reform. NT: Well, not enough. I mean, I think one of the things that happened when the pandemic started was that we actually saw a pretty remarkable reaction on the parts of jail systems and police where we recognize that, you know, some of the most profound vectors of COVID spread were going to be in congregate care facilities. That’s jails and prisons around the country. And jail populations dropped about 15 percent because sheriffs were letting go of people, judges were not imposing bail, police were issuing tickets rather than arresting and sending folks to jail. And so that was actually a very positive sort of, general reaction to see. We've seen those numbers start to tick back up, so it didn't quite have the durability that we would like it to. But one of the things that I think we learned at that moment in time is that it actually didn't cost people anything. Those decisions could be made, and people stayed safe. And there was a manifestation that what mattered was, you know, public health over public safety. And people’s humanity mattered. And so it was a remarkable thing to see, but we've got a lot more work to do. WPR: And to that point, I guess, what is the work that we have to do? What do you think we do in this moment to fix this system? NT: I think the most important thing that we can do is to redefine what we think delivers safety and safety for whom. So we have this pretty simplistic notion in this country. We grow up talking about bad guys and good guys, cops and robbers. We brand people as criminal for a certain act that they have committed, as if that is the sum total of who they are. But the formula that we have basically been fed, and I think mostly have ingested and tend to embrace as a people, is that if you want safety, you have to have police and you have to have prosecutors and you have to put people in jail and prison. But the fact of the matter is, is that we as a country are quite unusual in that we use this, this criminal legal system, to respond to an array of problems and challenges that people have that are really non-criminal. So I'll give you one statistic. Every year, about 10.5 million people are arrested in this country. So that's one every three seconds. So it just happened again. And it just happened again. And some people might be OK with that, and they think, ""Well, you know, it's a violent country, there are a lot of guns out there."" But when you look at statistics, one of the things that we see is that only five percent of those arrests are for violent crime. An 80 percent -- 80 percent -- so we're talking eight million of those arrests, which means people going to jail, getting a record that's going to make it hard for them to get a job, are for conduct that's associated with poverty, homelessness, mental illness and substance use. And so we're investing in this apparatus that sucks people into the system that isn't well adapted to address these complex problems, because many of these things are public health problems. Homelessness -- we should have supportive housing. Why would we lock someone up? If someone is decompensating, would we rather have two people with side arms pop out of a car and address that situation, or we'd rather have a trained person who actually knows how to de-escalate and understands mental illness and connect that person to the right kind of system? So what we need to do is invest less in this massive apparatus and invest in the things that we know will actually provide the kind of safety and the thriving and far less harm than what we currently have. So it has to be a fundamental, sort of, reordering of how we think about things. We have to be deprogrammed. And then we have to go out and we have to act and we have to vote on that and we have to participate in local elections for district attorneys and sheriffs and demand these kinds of changes. And demand from mayors and governors that they invest in public health and invest in communities rather than in the systems that end up harming them. WPR: So what you're describing is really this idea of decarceration and defunding the police, which has gotten a lot of air time in the past, you know, year or two. And I think there are definitely people who think that this idea feels either too pie-in-the-sky, that it’s too far from where we are right now as a nation to get there. And other people who maybe just feel like this just isn't the right way to go about fixing these issues. And so I'm curious what you would say to skeptics. NT: Well, you know, I mean, the first thing that I would recognize is that, you know -- so the language of defund is intentional, you know, provocation. And it sort of sharpened the issue. And I think that in the political context, Democrats have been very effectively trolled by Republicans and have been tagged with the issue. But if you really stop and you look at it, if I were to talk to you and I say, look, we're spending 115 billion dollars a year on policing. In major cities in this country, we're spending 30 percent to 40 percent, sometimes 50 percent on policing of a city budget. Not on housing, not on public health, not on substance abuse care and not on mental health care, on policing. And by the way, 80 percent of the things that the police are stopping people for are for conduct that relates to poverty and homelessness and mental illness and substance use. Does that make sense to you? Is that how you want to spend dollars? Is that what you believe is the right return on investment for societies? First of all, I think it's important you have to listen to people. And if they're fearful about crime, you've got to acknowledge that that might be the case. And certainly in communities where we've seen a lot of crime, people do have a right to be fearful. I come to this work because of my commitment to racial justice and equity. Others on the other side of the aisle might not. They might come to it for civil liberty reasons that, you know, they want to shrink the size of government, they don't like government overreach, they are concerned about how government spends its money. So I think it's important to figure out how to meet people where they're at to have the conversation that obviously requires listening first. And then the last thing that I'll say is that I would urge people to do exactly as we've done tonight, which is to recognize the humanity of people and to, you know, again, one in two Americans have had a family member who was incarcerated. And so I know there are people in this audience who have experienced that, who have maybe stuffed it away and are challenged by, you know, coming to terms with that stigma. But for us to remember what we would like for our sons and our daughters, or our brothers or our fathers, and to start from that perspective. So I would try to engage people on a human empathetic level. WPR: And just, I guess, as a final thought here. Do you feel hopeful, I guess, about this moment? Do you feel like we're moving in the right direction? NT: Most days. Most days, I feel hopeful. I mean, I talked about the deep roots of this system that we have, and I talked about the fact that this is something that democracy chose, that we all chose, that we can unchoose it, and we can act differently. I think it will take a long time. I'm very hopeful again that we're having the kinds of conversations that we are having tonight, that people are engaging. I see movement on the policy level, but I'm also not tricked into believing that it will be easy. And some of the same tools that we have seen that have created this apparatus -- the fear mongering, you know, sort of the iconography of gang bangers and, you know, cities of carnage and Willie Horton and all of these, sort of, the things that fueled this movement -- I see that again today. I see that on headlines. My mother-in-law visited for a while, she watched a lot of Fox News, I saw it 24 hours a day. And so that's dangerous. And so that makes me remember what, you know, what a task we have ahead of us and how much we're really going to have to lean in and to be resilient, to claim victories when we can. But to wake up the next day and know that we're going to have to reach harder and stronger to get more done. WPR: Thank you so much, Nick, you've given us a lot to think about. Thank you for being here tonight. NT: Thank you, Whitney, it's a pleasure. (Applause)"
0:00,Elizabeth Cox,Can you outsmart the fallacy that divided a nation?,Feb 2022,"What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares  to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr.  delivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’ and a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension  of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed  in Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right  to choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along with another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri and prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line  through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north  of the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where <i>I</i> have to draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based  on the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints, pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong, while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here: the pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all,  is to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those  among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor of ending slavery. In response to your many contorted arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery  is morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved other people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention  to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences in many situations. Failure to recognize the fact  that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible, is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless injustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people— which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for— fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise as a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln  was elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion  into new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War has broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved with a compromise."
15:28,Deval Patrick,A different understanding of American patriotism,Jan 2022,"Listen, I'm worried about our democracy. Nowadays, we have leaders who use division itself as a political tool. They downplay or even encourage, in some cases, a deadly assault to overturn an election. And a bunch of them are working really hard to make it harder to vote. The retreat from these processes of democracy, you know, ballot access, legislative debate, judicial review, they are worrisome enough. But what's even more concerning to me is the retreat from the purposes of democracy. These old-fashioned notions of government of, by and for the people. The rule of law as superior to the rule of any one personality. Liberty and justice for all. COVID made it harder to overlook deep disparities among us in health and wealth and education, and deep unfairness in too much of our policing, leaving a lot of Americans questioning whether our national commitment to social and economic justice is real. For some time now, in the words of one friend of mine, the self-evident truth that all people deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness seems a long way from settled in the American mind. So to me, American democracy, the supposed model of the form, Is up for grabs. I'm worried, not just as a lawyer or a former public official, but also and mainly as a patriot. I grew up on the south side of Chicago, in a crowded two-bedroom tenement, with my mother, my sister, my grandparents and various relatives who came and went. I went to big, overcrowded, underresourced, sometimes violent public schools. And yet my grandmother would never permit us to say we were poor. Just broke, she'd say, because broke is temporary. Think about it. Here is this refugee from the Jim Crow South who still believed in an America where with hard work, preparation and faith, both religious and civic, you could lift yourself from your circumstances of birth. I am for her the result and the symbol of her faith in America, so you better believe I'm a patriot. But patriotism for Black Americans is tricky. It's tricky to love a country that doesn't always love you back. I think of the Black men who set off to fight for freedom in the world wars and then came home to be denied those very freedoms. Some of them lynched while wearing their military uniforms. I think of the Black laborers who built great public universities, whose doors were closed to them. The Black voters who elected great public leaders whose policies like the GI Bill were closed to them. For a lot of our history, American democracy itself has been closed to Black people. Lots of grandmothers like mine have grandsons and granddaughters who never had their chance. Still don't. I remember in college, a white classmate asked me, ""Why on earth would you want to be Black?"" When I told her I hadn't considered the alternative -- (Laughter) and never would, she seemed startled and confused. I attribute this in part to the fact that I spoke and dressed like a preppy. I get that part. But mostly I think she was confused because she couldn't imagine why any Black person in his or her right mind wouldn't trade places with her. I think it would blow her mind, as it may some of yours, when I say I am also proud to be a patriot. Given our history, being Black and patriotic will certainly strike some people as strange, if not absurd. I don't know when patriotism turned into, you know, lapel pins and flyovers and silly arguments about pro football players taking a knee. My love of country is about national aspiration. America is the only nation in human history organized not by geography or a common culture or language or religion or even race, but by a handful of civic ideals. And we've come to define those ideals over time and through struggle as equality, opportunity and fair play. Why? Because that's what makes freedom possible. That's the America my grandmother believed in. That's the America that has made us a magnet to talent from all over the world. That's the America that makes me and countless other men and women from every race and background a patriot. In a way, the founders, for all their flaws, designed America to be a nation of values, a sort of a country with a conscience. And we’ve struggled with and against that conscience from the start. But true patriots understand, given that context, that America cannot be great without also being good. So when we cage refugee children to discourage their parents from seeking sanctuary here, true patriots know we cannot be great without being good. When bullets fly in houses of worship or in schools or in nightclubs or in grocery stores, and our leaders choose the slogans of the gun lobby over the lives of innocents, patriots know we cannot be great without being good. When unarmed Black and brown citizens are shot down by unaccountable police, when our justice system is not yet consistently just, patriots know we cannot be great without being good. When the economy moves on and leaves broken lives and broken expectations behind it, and our leaders just shrug, or when the public schools continue to fail poor children, and when we can always find the money for a weapons system the military doesn't want, but not the money for the health care a young family or senior needs, patriots know or must ask themselves: Can we be great without being good? And when we choose a power grab over a fair vote ... every true patriot knows we cannot be great without being good. Patriotism demands more than ceremony and sanctimony. It's about more than what you say you believe. it's about living the values of equality, opportunity and fair play. Even when it's inconvenient, even when it gets in the way of partisan advantage, even when it compels us to be mindful of and compassionate towards the lowly, the vulnerable, the different and the despised. Because that’s what American democracy is for. Of course, we have policies to fix, whether in job growth or education, in immigration or the justice system, or in these processes of democracy itself. But before we can fix our policies, we have to fix our politics. And by that, I am not just talking about better tone or hyperpartisanship or a willingness to compromise. As important as all of that is, I'm talking about our purpose. Sure, we should debate, and we always do, what role government should play in any of this, in meeting our civic obligations. But let's try for once not to forget in the heat of the debate that social and economic justice was the point from the start. But I think saving our democracy will take more, not just from elected officials or civic leaders or the media, but more from each one of us. And we're going to have to start, I think, by putting our cynicism down. I'm going to give you an example of what I mean. Near the end of my time in office, America faced a crisis not unlike today's when there were all these unaccompanied children, some as young as three and four years old, who were flooding across the southern border, having fled over thousands of miles from violence in Central America. And then, just like now, the federal authorities were overwhelmed. So President Obama, who was in office at the time, called on a number of states to temporarily shelter and care for some of these children while they were being processed under our laws. Feelings around immigration ran hot then, just like now. Even so, I agreed that our Commonwealth would help because sheltering poor children fleeing unspeakable violence was, to me, an act of patriotism. America has given sanctuary to desperate children for more than a century. We rescued Irish children from famine, Russian and Ukrainian children from religious persecution, Cambodian children from genocide, Haitian children from earthquakes, Sudanese children from civil war, our own New Orleans children from Hurricane Katrina. Once in 1939, we turned our backs on Jewish children fleeing the Nazis. And it remains a blight on our national reputation, as I fear the separation of children in the last administration will be remembered. The point is that our esteem and our power is enhanced when we rescue the desperate -- and diminished when we don't. Still, I'm not naive. I knew my decision would be controversial, and indeed, for that decision, I was called on hate radio and in social media everything but a child of God. A couple of days after I announced my decision, on an unusually quiet Saturday morning, my wife Diane gave me a list of stuff to go get at the Home Depot, proving for some of you who know her that there is no office high enough that excuses you from one of her honey-do lists. (Laughter) It was early in the day, and I thought I'd just slip out quickly, you know, on my own, without bothering my security detail. What harm could come of that, right? I knew exactly where I was going and where to find everything on my list. So I set off in the truck, in a T-shirt and jeans and flip-flops, dark glasses and a baseball cap. And it didn't matter. I was outed by the manager in the very first aisle. “Good morning, governor! Welcome to the Home Depot. How can I help you?"" I encountered a man in the checkout line who was red-hot mad. You know, not hostile or threatening, just really angry and loud, and he let me have it. ""Governor,"" he said, ""I couldn't disagree with you more about your decision,"" he said. ""My own wife is an immigrant. She came here legally. That's the way it ought to be. And I just want you to know I think you're wrong."" Now, in that circumstance, there was no point in trying to engage with him about how being a refugee is legal under American law. I just thanked him for his feedback. But everybody in the checkout line and in that area of the store knew who was mad at whom and what he was mad about. Now I had six other encounters in the store on the same subject. And in every one of those someone came up and whispered: ""Governor, you're doing the right thing."" ""Governor, thanks for looking out for those kids."" ""Governor, I'm with you."" The calls to the office were two and three to one in favor of sheltering those children. And when I reflect on that, I think to myself: When did we learn to shout our anger and to whisper our kindness? It's completely upside down. I don't know if that's the reality TV culture we live in or what, but it's totally backwards. It's time we learned again to shout kindness, to shout compassion, to shout justice. That's the purpose of American democracy and the source of our greatness. Blessedly, we're starting to see more and more expressions of this kind of thing across this country. More and more people coming off the sidelines, overcoming their cynicism and fatalism and standing up for America at her generous and optimistic best. From women who are demanding to be treated with the respect and decency everyone deserves. From survivors of domestic violence and abuse demanding to be seen and heard and believed. From Black and brown people who are demanding consistent professionalism and the presumption of innocence from police. From students who are demanding we choose their lives and safety over the proliferation of military weapons in civilian hands. From all those lawyers who showed up at polling places in 2020 or at airports after the so-called Muslim ban, demanding respect for the rule of law. Black Lives Matter. Time's Up. Black Girl Magic. Occupy Wall Street, Families Belong Together. At any given time on any given issue, they may make any one of us uncomfortable. But they have taken to the legislatures, to the ballot boxes, to the courtrooms and peacefully to the streets to lay claim to their democracy, its purpose as well as its processes, and ultimately to affirm the American conscience. They are shouting kindness. If American-style democracy is to have a chance, more of us had better put our own cynicism down, summon up our own patriotism and join them. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
18:00,Reuben Jonathan Miller,How radical hospitality can change the lives of the formerly incarcerated,Jan 2022,"There are few things we know about mass incarceration in our country. We know, for example, that we're the world's leading jailer. With five percent of the world's population, we incarcerate 20 percent of its prisoners. And we know that we punish our poor, our own. Half of the [imprisoned] -- in fact, well over half -- live below the poverty line. This is nothing to say about the egregious racial disparities in how we administer justice and how we choose to punish. Black Americans are five times more likely to be incarcerated than white Americans. And they do lengthier sentences, even for the same crimes. This is punishment in the United States. But what is punishment for? When does punishment end? Why do we punish in this way? In the 1970s, we said that punishment was for the purpose of rehabilitation. But on the heels of the civil rights movement and a predictable, because it was cyclical, crime wave, we decided that rehabilitation no longer worked. In fact, our policymakers said that nothing worked for people like them. That is to say, the people that we lock away in our American jails and prisons, the kinds of people that we put in a cage. We made a political decision in that moment that what we would do is we would sentence people to longer terms in prison and that we would make sure that the punishments were more harsh. But my research shows that punishment doesn't end when the sentence ends. I'm a sociologist. I began this work as a volunteer chaplain at the Cook County Jail in Chicago, and it was there that I was confronted with the realities of mass incarceration. It was there that I was greeted by a sea of faces that look like mine, from neighborhoods that look like mine because I was born poor and Black after 1972. This is the year that mass incarceration began in earnest. And I was confronted by the reality that the people I spent time with were not just my neighbors, they were certainly more than just criminals. These are people who had families, who loved people and who were loved by people. These were people who contributed to their homes and to their sense of community. So I had to know what happened when they went home. I had to know what brought them there in the first place. So I began to study mass incarceration. I spent two decades following people that we've learned to be afraid of. A man I call Jimmy Caldwell was one of those people. He spent two decades on and off in Michigan jails and prisons. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but didn't get access to medical care or the medication that he needed. I met him on the day of his release. He was handed a sheet of paper. This is known as the conditions of release, and they list things that you may not do. You may not cross state lines; you may not own a weapon; you may not drink even if you’re of age; you may not use substances, including marijuana, even in states where it’s legal; you may not associate with so-called known offenders. This is an impossibility in a city like Detroit, where crime and incarceration, by the way, is concentrated in so few neighborhoods. It’s also an impossibility in cities like Chicago or LA or New York, or any of the major places where people live. I wanted to know how he met these restrictions. But more than the things that he couldn't do, he was given a new set of responsibilities. You must report to a probation officer once a week at least. You must submit to and pay for a urinalysis. You must attend Narcotics Anonymous. You must do this multiple times each week. You must also go to a workforce development program. You must get a job. You must do all of this before 3pm each day, because that’s your curfew. And you must wear an ankle bracelet so we can monitor your movement. Violation of any of these rules can cost you your freedom. How did Jimmy make these appointments? He was effectively homeless. He had no money for transportation. How did he reconnect with his family, the people whom he loved and who loved him? So I decided to follow Jimmy, as I followed people like him for so many years before. We met at the Rosa Parks Transit Center in Detroit, this is a bus depot near midtown. This was one of the coldest days of the year. It was February of 2015, and Jimmy was unprepared. He didn't have a coat. He wore a Detroit Tigers baseball jacket. And he didn't have a winter hat, not a full one, he had a thin worn skullcap that he wore. This is one of those days where your teeth chatter. It's one of those days where you can see your breath. And here's Jimmy. No scarf, no gloves. And here's where we have to go to a workforce development center that's at least a half-hour walk from where the last bus could drop him off. So here we are, walking to the center. It's very cold. And during this walk, Jimmy does his best to make me feel comfortable. He tells me no fewer than five times, ""Man, I appreciate spending time with a brother like you."" This is what he says. He says, ""I'm glad to be doing something positive."" This is what he tells me. And he begins to compliment me until I feel uncomfortable. I think he’s trying to butter me up for something; I think he's prepared me for the ask, I'm not very comfortable with compliments. This isn't my thing. But when I got to the center with Jimmy, I understood in a much deeper way why he went through those motions. The entire building was closed. There was a loose leaf sheet of paper taped to the front window that had the address to hopefully open centers that he might be able to go to. There was no phone number on that paper, so we couldn’t call ahead to make sure it was open, and it didn't matter if there was a phone number. Jimmy's phone had run out of minutes long before, he couldn't have called if he wanted to. I wish I could tell you that I gave Jimmy a ride to that center because I'm a good guy and I thought he was a good guy in a bad situation. I wish I could say that; I think I'd earn points on humanitarian grounds. But the truth of the matter is I gave Jimmy a ride because I was cold. I didn't feel like walking nine miles. I didn't feel like getting on the bus. So we hopped in my car and we made our way. Miles through the Detroit traffic. But it didn't matter. When we got to the new center, the one that was nine miles away, a center that was ironically close to the place where Jimmy slept at night -- By the way, he was doing off-the-books demolition work for his old dope dealer; the dope dealer started buying and selling real estate; in exchange for Jimmy’s work, he allowed him to sleep there. We get to this place that's so close to his home, but that he was made to travel so far away because he was ordered to go to somewhere else. And by the time we get there, the training classes were full. There was no space for Jimmy. They tell him to come back the next week in case another person on probation failed to show up. We grab brochures on the way out the door, and we headed to Coney Island, this is a Detroit diner chain, so that Jimmy and I could debrief about the day's activities. Jimmy thanked me profusely for the seven-dollar lunch that I bought him, for the bus card that I gave him in exchange for the interview that took place, and for being there for him. For being there. What did I do? Jimmy's life moved from one rejection to another. The prison refused him psychiatric care. The social service agency shuttered its doors. Without me, he wouldn't have made it to his appointment. And with me, it just didn't matter, he was turned away anyway. He wouldn't even have a place to stay without his dope dealer. And homelessness, by the way, is a violation of parole. All of this would have to be explained to his probation officer, who may not believe him. And this is a fantastic story. Jimmy lived at the mercy and the kindness of others. He needed them for food, for clothing, for shelter, for transportation, to maintain his freedom, his very freedom. This is all a matter of public policy. Jimmy, like 19.6 million Americans in our country, 20 million people, a population that's ten times the size of the jail and prison census, those people live with felony records. They live in an alternate legal reality. What I write about as a ""supervised society."" In the supervised society, 44,000 laws, policies and administrative sanctions dictate where they may go, with whom they might live and how they spend their time. If you've got a criminal record, even if that record was from a lifetime ago, even if you've changed your ways in ways that only your family might hope that you would, it's nearly impossible to get work. 19,000 labor market restrictions ensure that. It's nearly impossible to rent an apartment without help. Over a thousand housing regulations ensure that. Four thousand regulations on civic engagement, 1,000 regulations on family and domestic rights, almost ensuring that if you've got a criminal record that you can't live with the people that you want to live with most. How did we get here? How did we get to this supervised society? The roots run deep, at least as deep as our country. But the legal infrastructure for a supervised society began in the 1980s. It starts in housing policy. Congress passed legislation that made it so that landlords would reject applicants with criminal records, and people in public housing had the power to evict tenants who allow people with criminal records who even so much as visited their home. Overnight, grandmothers were being evicted for the crime of letting their loved ones sleep on a couch. This is the supervised society. This is the world that we've made. I caught up with Jimmy a few months later. I wanted to know how he was doing. But mostly, I want to know about his relationship with his mother. His mother was a fantastic woman. I talked to her on the phone a couple of times, and I knew she adored Jimmy. This made sense because Jimmy was her baby. He was the youngest of her five children and the only boy in that house. She certainly would have helped Jimmy if he turned to her, and she did often. But Jimmy told me that her landlord started asking questions. He saw Jimmy making his way around the building and he didn't want any trouble. Thousands of families have been evicted from their homes for the crime of letting a loved one sleep on the couch. Thousands more live under the threat of eviction for simply allowing someone with a criminal record to stay there for a few days. Jimmy certainly needed his mother. She certainly would have responded to his need. But he told me, ""I don't come around like that no more. I don't want to put her in that position."" Jimmy avoided his mother, the one person who would have helped him, because she wanted to help. He avoided her to protect her. Americans say, ""We believe in rehabilitation,"" it's what we say. How do we explain Jimmy's life? We say we believe in a second chance, but how do we explain this perpetual punishment that lasts a lifetime? This is the fact of mass incarceration, and it is indeed a fact. I know this, I know it from my flesh. My brother was incarcerated while I did the research I'm telling you about today. And I could tell you stories about the trouble that he had when he tried to find a job or get an apartment. I could tell you how hard it was for him to find his place in the world, but I'd rather tell you a different story. I'd rather tell you a story about a man who helped us find our way out. Ronald Simpson Bay was handed a 50-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. He's a remarkable man. He fought that case for 27 years, one of the few jailhouse lawyers who managed to get himself out. He helped many people while he was inside, he's helped even more today, now that he's home. He's one of the nation's leading advocates for criminal justice reform. But it wasn't always good for Ronald, obviously. About 10 years into his sentence, Ronald's only son, a boy who holds his name, was murdered by a 14-year-old boy. I don't know what I would have done. I can only tell you what Ronald did. Ronald went to the judge and to the prosecutor, and he advocated for that boy, that he be tried as a juvenile instead of as an adult. This boy who took so much from him. He made sure that he would have a second chance at life. ""How did you do it, Ronald?"" ""Why did you do it, Ronald, I would have hated that child."" ""What were you thinking at the time?"" Ronald said to me, ""I advocated for that boy because it was the right thing to do. I thought it would be an example for others who needed to move on with their life."" Ronald did not love his son's murderer, how could he? But Ronald made an ethical commitment, and he did with those ethics required. Ronald practices a radical politics of hospitality. One where we make a place in the world for people who even cause us harm. And he invites us to practice these politics. Because this politic of hospitality, this radical commitment to belonging will take us so far beyond the politics of fear that govern our lives today. Out of fear we've written 44,000 laws to prevent people from harming us. But the laws that we've written have done the opposite. Any criminologists worth their salt will tell you this. They'll tell you that unemployment, that family separation, that housing instability, that all of these things lead to more crime, not less. They make our world more violent, not less. But we do it because it made us feel good, and we did this despite what we know. So how do we find our way out? How do we end this permanent punishment that we've decided to enact? How do we get out of the supervised society that we've decided to legislate? Well, first, we can get to know people with criminal records. The statistics are grim, but it's in these grim statistics that I find hope. One in two Americans has a formerly incarcerated loved one. This means that most of us can start right at home. We can get to know the people in our closest circles because if we ask the question, if we try to see, then we'll notice that people are closer to us than we imagined. And we can, of course, ask our elected officials to do something different. All politics are local, and the politics of mass incarceration are hyperlocal. Mass incarceration was the result of a thousand policy decisions, so we can ask more of our judges, our district attorneys, more of the people that we elect to the mayor's and governor's office. More to our local politicians who help govern our wards and our cities and our towns. We can ask them to help us imagine a new world. We can even ask this of our employers and of the people in leadership in our houses of worship. They can help us find a new world, or we can find new people who will. But above all, Ronald calls us to practice this radical politics of hospitality. And this is what I think is the real measure of our ethics. It's what did you do when things are hard. It's easy to love the lovable. But Ronald calls to us to practice a politic of hospitality, to make a world where we can imagine a place for everyone so that all belong. And he asked us to imagine this world, even for people who've caused harm. And he asked us to imagine it, even for people who've harmed us. And from there, I take great hope. Thank you. (Applause)"
0:00,Alex Gendler,"Blood, concrete, and dynamite: Building the Hoover Dam",Dec 2021,"High above the floor  of Nevada’s Black Canyon, a group of men repelled down the cliff face. Suddenly, a man stumbled  over the canyon rim. He plummeted past the men,  too fast for them to grab— when another climber swung  out from the rocks and carried him to safety. Once they’d repelled  the engineer up the cliff, his savior swung back to business as usual— just another day in the construction  of the Hoover Dam. In the early 20th century, the United States had expanded  from coast to coast, but many cities in the arid southwest still lacked reliable water sources. While the Colorado River had been diverted into a series of canals, its erratic flow and frequent floods made it unreliable for agriculture. At the same time, the region’s growing cities and industries continually needed more energy. So in 1922, the Bureau of Reclamation decided to solve all these problems in one fell swoop by building  a massive hydroelectric dam. Ensuring water rights for the project required unprecedented cooperation between all seven states along the river. But once local governments agreed, the Bureau determined that Black Canyon’s narrow gorge was best suited for an arch-gravity dam. This design curves upstream, using the force of oncoming water to push the structure into its supports— in this case, the canyon walls. Arch dams have been built  since ancient times, but never on such a massive scale. When complete, the structure would be 221 by 379 meters. It would take an enormous labor force to build a dam this massive. And when the Great Depression struck  only a year after the project’s approval, thousands of families looking for work began flocking to the site. The earliest arrivals lived in a makeshift encampment called Ragtown. With no infrastructure, scarce supplies, and little protection from the elements, several residents died of heatstroke. So to better house workers, the government designed and built the still thriving Boulder City, complete with numerous amenities, including a state-of-the-art hospital. Before construction on the dam  could begin, the entire river had to be rerouted. Building these diversion tunnels required blasting into each side of the canyon to create 17 meter tall tubes. With a combined length of almost 5 kilometers, these tunnels could divert roughly  5,600 cubic meters of water per second. However, workers faced grueling conditions to finish these on time, and dozens succumbed  to the scorching heat. By the fall of 1932, the river had been successfully redirected. But the most dangerous work was still ahead. Over 1 million cubic meters  of loose rock needed to be cleared from the canyon walls. So foremen brought in high scalers  who descended the cliffs on ropes, removing rubble with jackhammers and dynamite. From circus acrobats and former sailors, to local Apache, these death-defying individuals performed some of the most dangerous— and glamorous— work on site. After the walls were cleared,  it was finally time to build the dam. This required pouring over 6.6 million  tons of concrete— enough to pave a road  across the entire US. But so much concrete poured at once would take far too long to cool and harden. So to speed this process up, concrete was poured in interlocking blocks of varying sizes, each containing steel pipes flowing with cold water. By 1935, most of the structure had been completed two years ahead of schedule. On February 1st, the diversion tunnels opened to fill the dam’s reservoir, capable of holding twice  the Colorado River’s annual flow. Upon completion, the dam was the tallest manmade structure in the world. However, the speed of its construction came at the cost of worker safety. While this project employed roughly 21,000 Americans during a major economic crisis, over 100 people died during construction. Creating the reservoir also destroyed communities like St. Thomas and devastated the Colorado River  ecosystem. Today, the Hoover Dam generates  over 4 billion kilowatt-hours annually, providing electricity  for over 1.3 million people. But the consequences of its construction continue to cast a shadow over this monumental structure."
0:00,Ned Blackhawk and Jeffrey D. Means,The dark history of Mount Rushmore,Dec 2021,"Between 1927 and 1941, 400 workers blasted 450,000 tons of rock from a mountainside using chisels,  jackhammers, and a lot of dynamite. Gradually, they carved out Mount Rushmore. Now, the monument draws nearly 3 million people to South Dakota’s Black Hills every year. But its façade belies a dark history. About 10,000 years ago, Native American people began inhabiting the Black Hills. The area became especially sacred to the Lakota people, who formed the western branch  of what the US called the Sioux Nation. The Lakota believed one cave  within the Black Hills to be where they first emerged. And they named one  of the Black Hills mountain peaks the Six Grandfathers  after their sacred directional spirits. But in the 1800s, Lakota access  to this land came under threat. White settlers in North America  expanded their territories by using physical violence or negotiating  with Indigenous peoples. After its establishment in the late 1700s, the US government ratified hundreds  of treaties with Native American nations. However, it often broke them  or created them using coercion. Between 1866 in 1868, the Lakota and their allies successfully defended their land  from the U.S. military and negotiated a new treaty with the government. In the 1868 Treaty at Fort Laramie, all parties agreed that a vast territory, including the Black Hills, belonged to the Sioux Nation. In return, the Lakota would allow  US travelers to pass safely through. But many aspects of the Treaty also aimed to assimilate the Lakota into white culture. This included incentives to convert them from hunting to farming, abandon their nomadic lifestyle,  and wear clothes the US provided. Meanwhile, just seven years later, the US broke the treaty after an expedition found gold  in the Black Hills. Miners set up camps, the military attacked and ultimately defeated the Lakota, and the US passed legislation illegally seizing the land. 50 years later,  workers began etching into the Lakota’s  sacred Six Grandfather’s Mountain. The project was led by an arrogant sculptor named Gutzon Borglum, who had ties to the KKK. A historian originally proposed that  Mount Rushmore include Western figures— like Lakota Chief Red Cloud. But Borglum chose to feature his own heroes. By October of 1941, Borglum had died from surgical complications and work stopped, though the project was unfinished. None of the four figures had torsos,  as intended, and rubble was left piled below. To the Lakota, the monument  was a desecration. And the presidents immortalized  on the rockface all had brutal anti-Indigenous legacies. Members of the Iroquois Confederacy called George Washington “Town Destroyer” for encouraging military campaigns  that burned 50 of their villages in 1779. Theodore Roosevelt championed  forced assimilation and said, “I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of 10 are.” In 1980, after the Sioux Nation had sued the US for treaty violations, the Supreme Court ruled that the  Black Hills had been unlawfully taken, and the Sioux were entitled  to compensation. The amount named has since reached over a billion dollars. But the Sioux Nation refused  to take the money and to give up their claim to the Black Hills, maintaining that they were never for sale. So, what should happen to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills? Responses to that question are wide-ranging. Some, including tribal leaders  and Borglum’s great-granddaughter, have called for Mount Rushmore to be removed. Others see it as an important patriotic symbol and vital aspect of South Dakota's economy that should remain. Many Lakota people want  the 1868 Treaty to be honored and the now-federally controlled lands to be returned to their tribal communities. Others have said that the Lakota  and the US should at least co-manage parts of the Black Hills. Currently, there are no plans for change. The US broke many of its promises  with Indigenous nations making issues like this common. Native people have been fighting for broken treaties to be honoured for generations, achieving some major victories  along the way. Meanwhile, if untouched, the faces engraved  on the Six Grandfathers Mountain are expected to remain  for thousands of years to come."
16:48,Kathryn Kolbert,The end of Roe v. Wade — and what comes next for reproductive freedom,Dec 2021,"""What's the Supreme Court going to do about abortion?"" “They’re not really going to overturn Roe v. Wade, are they?” ""They can't do that, can they?"" I can't tell you how many people have asked me questions like this in recent months. It makes sense. I have argued two abortion cases in the US Supreme Court, including the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which is credited with saving Roe v. Wade. I was a co-founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights, and I spent 20 years of my career arguing on behalf of women who needed abortions and other reproductive health care. So my answer is depressing but direct: Roe v. Wade will be dead within the year. The constitutional right to choose whether or not to have an abortion will no longer be protected by the United States Constitution. This court is likely to overrule Roe and Casey or so undermine its meaning that it will be effectively unavailable for use. Now I heard your gasps, I'm going to say it again. The Federal Constitution of the United States will no longer protect reproductive freedom. Now I'm also here to tell you that there's hope. That we can preserve, by working together, our reproductive freedoms. And by that, I mean more than just the right to choose abortion. By that, I mean the ability to make decisions about becoming parents. All people should have that right. Whatever their race, whatever their gender, whoever they love, all people ought to have the right to decide to become parents and the social supports that are necessary to raise those children with dignity and in safety. So opponents argue three things when they say they want to ban abortion. They talk about religion; they talk about protection of fetal rights; they talk about protection of women's health. So let's take those each in turn. Religion. You know, the reality of the world is that the world's religions have a wide variety of views on abortion, and many support them in a whole range of different circumstances. So when abortion opponents say religion, they're really just imposing their religion on the rest of us. And what about protection of fetal rights? If in fact you cared about protecting fetal rights, you'd spend a lot of time working to eliminate the alarming rate of infant mortality in this country. (Applause) Because in the United States, we have one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the developed world. They also should be supporting programs for children once they are born. (Applause) You know, what about the protection of women's health? Well, the reality is, abortion is already an extremely safe surgical procedure. It is safer than childbirth. And imposing new restrictions on abortion only makes it less safe. In my view, what we're really talking about, this fixation on abortion by opponents, those people who want to ban abortion, is all about controlling women. And women are unable to operate, to be equal participants in our society, if we cannot control whether, when and with whom we have children. We cannot exercise the fundamental human right to make decisions about our bodies and our destinies. So why am I so convinced that the Supreme Court is going to overrule Roe and Casey and take what is clearly a radical step? Now, interestingly enough, I learned everything I needed to know to be successful in the Supreme Court on “Sesame Street.” (Laughter) Why? Because you've got to learn to count. And the only number that matters is five -- (Laughter) which is a majority of the justices on the Court. Now, when Casey went to the High Court in 1992, I was convinced that there were five justices then prepared to overrule Roe and return to the states the ability to ban abortion. I was correct. Right after my argument, the justices returned to their conference room and took a vote, and seven justices voted to uphold the Pennsylvania restrictions that were at issue in the case. And then Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a draft opinion. While he never said the magic words, that Roe is fatal, as Justice John Paul Stevens recently wrote in his memoir, the opinion effectively repudiated the central holding of Roe. Now, luckily, that opinion was never filed in 1992. At the last minute, Justice Anthony Kennedy changed his mind, and together with justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, they issued what they called a joint opinion. And in it, they upheld the right of women to obtain abortion up until viability, usually between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, in all 50 states and US territories. But the Casey decision went a little further, and it had permitted states to enact barriers to abortion as long as they weren't undue burdens on women. And as a result, in the following three decades, we’ve seen states pass hundreds of restrictions on abortion, and the increasingly conservative courts uphold those restrictions. And as a result, we've seen a dwindling availability of abortion. Today, about 11 percent of the counties in this country that actually have an abortion provider. There are six states that have one abortion provider. As we know, in the days before Roe, women with means were able to get abortions. Other women, on the other hand, even today -- low-income women, women who live in rural areas, teenagers, women of color, women who are disabled -- all of whom have difficulty accessing safe and affordable abortion. Now the question is: What’s going to happen now? And unfortunately, things are going to get worse. There are currently three cases pending in the Supreme Court, two from Texas and one from Mississippi. Now, most of you probably have been following the Texas situation. Texas passed a ban on abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy. It allowed any individual to sue abortion providers. Vigilantes could collect a bounty of 10,000 dollars for a violation of the law. And as a result, many, many clinics, probably most of the clinics in Texas, have closed their doors or have decreased the number of abortions they performed. It's difficult. But the critical piece about Texas is that five justices -- remember that number five -- five justices already voted to permit the Texas law to go into effect. And besides the harm for women, those justices are not really considering the constitutionality of the act, only who can be sued and where. The more important case is out of Mississippi. There, there's a ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Arguments were heard this week, and in my view, we are likely to see at least five justices overrule Roe and Casey and send the question of abortion back to the states. Sesame Street, five votes. And unfortunately, this time around, there is no Justice Kennedy to save us. Now, what's going to happen when Roe and Casey are overturned? I'd guess that about half the states in this country will ban all or most abortions. We're likely to see ban stretching from Georgia all the way west to Texas, from Idaho, all the way south to Arizona. Women, like Texan women, will be forced to travel to the 15 states that are controlled by pro-choice legislators and governors. Other women will seek medication abortion, using the internet or gray or black markets and subject themselves in some states to criminal prosecutions. Still, other women will carry their unintended pregnancies to term. The bottom line is this is not a pretty picture. So what now? What can we do? We have been saying for five decades, ""Save Roe, save Roe, save Roe."" That strategy is no longer feasible. Give it up. We've got to make sure we quit hitting our heads against the marble staircase. And try to find new strategies. So I'm going to propose two of them to you today. First, we’ve got to build a badass social justice movement. (Applause) Which means loudly crying for our rights, loudly saying: this is something that belongs to us. We know from watching the Black Lives Matter movement and the marriage equality movement that coalition is queen. We've got to find allies and work with them to make sure our rights are protected. But equally important, we've got to ensure that we elect -- and I'd actually say more important -- is we've got to elect legislators, throughout the states and in Congress, who are champions for reproductive health. Now, I'm not going to bother to tell you all how to get politically active. This is a crowd that knows how to do it. But knowing how to do it and actually doing it are two different things, so what you need to do is get politically active. But one of the things I will tell you is what would our world look like if we were able to wrest the reins of governmental power away from those who oppose abortion and allow an agenda that reflects reproductive freedoms and justice. Picture this. We would have childcare and universal childhood education in every community in this country. We would have paid maternity and paternity leaves, and people would actually take them. All working parents ought to have that right. You know -- (Applause) According to the Centers for Disease Control, African American women, Native American women, Alaska Native women are dying of pregnancy-related causes at three times the rate of white women. And most of those deaths are preventable. So in our world where we control the reins of power, we would ensure, we would ensure that there were programs to reduce this alarming rate of maternal mortality. And we would make sure that the systemic racism in our health care system would be eliminated. And we'd work to eliminate infertility with special programs for women who can't get pregnant. And we would make sure that all women are entitled to health care services at all stages of their life. Now all of those things I've talked about, are family-friendly policies and ought to be supported by our opponents as well. I'll wait to see if that's the case. But in my world where we control the reins of power, we would do more. The birth control pill would be available over the counter. (Applause) OK, as easy to get as a bottle of Tylenol. And we'd have quality sex education in every public school in this country. (Applause) And we would make sure that ... abortion is affordable and available -- no more bans, no more barriers, no more restrictions on funding. And medication abortion, the abortion pill, would be available not just at Planned Parenthoods and the dwindling number of abortion clinics in this country, but at pharmacies without a prescription, at walk-in health centers and on every college campus in the United States. (Applause) And if you had any doubt about the importance of getting politically active, we could also pass a constitutional amendment, what I call a gender equity amendment, that would guarantee to all persons the ability to make decisions not just about abortion, but about pregnancy and marriage and sexuality and parenting. And it would be a permanent part of the United States Constitution. Now the important part of that is these rights should not be controlled by politicians. They shouldn't be dependent on where you live or how much money you make or the color of your skin or the person you love or the pronouns you use. These are universal fundamental human rights, and they ought to be guaranteed in law, in the Constitution, so the Supreme Court cannot willy-nilly take them away. (Applause) Now to do this, we need to elect champions for choice to the 500,000 elected seats in our government in this country: everything from school boards to town councils, to state legislatures to Congress and the White House. All of those seats need to be controlled by champions of our cause. And that can only happen if you get politically active. Your vote, your willingness to work in campaigns, write postcards, make phone calls, knock on doors, can make that happen. And even run for office, because that's what we need to do. Now while dire, the end of Roe is not the end of the story. To paraphrase Joan Baez, the best antidote to despair is action. And your action, your willingness to work hard cannot only preserve reproductive freedoms for ourselves but for our children as well. So let's do it. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"
6:11,Larry Irvin,A program to empower Black teachers in the US,Nov 2021,"I had a chance to teach a summer program a few years back in my hometown of New Orleans. I had a group of 32 young men, age ranging from nine to 14, all Black boys. I wanted to set a tone the first day of class. I want to compare and contrast the mindsets of the contemporary young folk in contrast to my constituents and how we grew up and how we aspired. So I asked them the old cliché question: What do you want to be when you grow up? Here were the responses. Twenty nine said Kevin Durant. Three said LeBron James. Now, I had two thoughts. First was I was flabbergasted because, obviously, these young boys don't know basketball. Because LeBron is the man, if you ask me. But my second thought was, the narrative still hasn't changed. The scope of possibility is still very limited. Sports, streets, entertainment. We don't see ourselves really outside of those arenas. Something has to change. But my mom was an educator. She laid a very positive foundation for myself and my sister, Charlene, in regards to education. But what she did, most importantly, was she made me a dreamer. She opened up that scope of possibilities, and now I’m the CEO of an organization that recruits Black male teachers. Being a teacher is one of the most impactful ways you can see your impact as a professional. Being a Black male teacher is a game changer. Being a Black male teacher is becoming a superhero. So let's talk about him. Let's take a look at the landscape currently in the United States. Less than three percent of all teachers are Black men. For my liberal arts majors that's three out of 100. (Laughs) Now, Black men are in classrooms as disciplinarians, as janitors, as intervention specialists and definitely as athletic coaches. In front of the classroom, leading from an intellectual capacity, not so much. But I want to take the first step and juxtapose it to that of another. Just one Black male teacher in third, fourth or fifth grade for a low-income Black boy substantially reduces his chances of dropping out of high school by almost 40 percent. Let that sink in. Just imagine if you had two. And that's what I do. Kids are what they see. They need that affirmation. So I provide the mirror. We provide the mirror. At Brothers Empowered to Teach, we recruit Black male teachers. So how do we do what we do? Attachment. We offer a three-year undergraduate fellowship to college-aged Black men. Our criteria are simple. You got to have a 2.5, be enrolled at least half-time in college and obviously be a Black male. The first year, the program is just an observation year, we like to take a gradual, slow approach to teaching. We have an old saying in New Orleans: “You can’t microwave gumbo.” You've got to slow-cook it. And that's the approach we take with teachers. Year one is a simple observation, you may lead homework activities, recreational activities for 10 or 12 hours a week. Year two and three are your lab development years where you learn the pedagogy, classroom management, shadowing teachers, lesson planning, things of that nature. It all culminates in placement into the classroom. But the really special sauce of our program is our internal, personal and professional development, the Cipher series. The Cipher series is where young men get a chance to break down and dissect, sort of recalibrate their compasses, if you will, in regards to being a Black man in this world today, but also being a Black man in education. Our topics of discourse range from masculinity, résumés, networking, relationships, you name it. See what we’re trying to do is really push this envelope in regards to attachment. We take a holistic approach to education. We develop good people. And then in turn they manifest into great educators, people over pedigrees, dispositions over degrees. I think about our first fellow, Alex Halstead. Dillard University attendee, arbitrary major. Like a lot of our young Black men, walking around Dillard’s campus, not much direction. Creative writing major, didn't have a plan, was told to go to school like a lot of us was told to go to school because it's the right thing to say from your parents. Alex had no true direction. Alex came to our program, we put Alex in front of the kids. He became a mirror, but also they became a mirror for him as well. See, it’s a double reflection when Black kids see a Black male and then a Black male sees a Black kid. They reflect for themselves, and that's what we do. We create the connection to the classroom for a demographic and a group that hasn't been represented as far as education as long as I can remember. They were removed from the conversation from an intellectual standpoint as students, but also as teachers. As I think about it, man, I think three, five, 10 years from now, if we circle back to the conversation about what do you want to be, and I pose that question again to my young boys, maybe we can add a couple of names to those lists. Maybe we can say Kevin Durant, LeBron James and also Mr. Halstead, and maybe even Mr. Irving. Yeah. Mr. Irving. I like the ring of that. Thank you."
3:18,Mona Chalabi,Which box do I check?,Nov 2021,"If you've been watching this series, you'll know I care about data. But data has its limitations, especially when it comes to language. Basically, if you get your categories wrong, you can wind up with some pretty misleading statistics, and the US Census is a prime example. [Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi] Taken every 10 years, this survey aims to collect demographic data from each and every resident of the US and its territories. Those responses help the government to determine everything, from the allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College, to the allocation of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds. And those funds pay for things like new hospitals, road improvements and school lunch programs. And crucially, the statisticians that work there are nonpartisan. They sit at the same desks, applying the same formulas, no matter who is in charge at the White House. So undoubtedly, the US Census Bureau does important work, but it does have some blind spots. For example, there has been a decades-long effort to add the category Middle Eastern or Northern African or MENA to the census. Currently, the census defines people from these regions, and that includes me, as white. Yeah, that's incorrect. In 2015, the census did test a version of this survey that included MENA. It found that when given the MENA option, the number of people from that region who identified as white dropped from 86 percent to 20 percent. See, when you reconsider language, the numbers can change dramatically. Unfortunately, though, the census still didn't make the change, saying that further tests were necessary to determine if MENA should appear under ethnicity instead of race. That means that those who have rallied for its inclusion will have to wait another decade to see if our community can be recognized. This isn't the first time that language has restricted how people are represented in the census. The very first one, way back in 1790, only had three broad categories, and I quote: ""slaves, free white men and women, and all other free persons."" It would be another 30 years before distinct categories for free Blacks and another 40 years before American Indians would appear on the census. Since then, more and more categories have been added, but progress has been slow. It wasn't until 2000 that people could choose more than one race to describe themselves, and for the very first time in 2020, people who selected Black or white could go a bit more granular and provide more detail about their origins, like naming France or Somalia or spotlighting their Indigenous identity. Right now, you might be thinking: Why does the wording on a survey even matter? Race and ethnicity are social constructs anyway. But that doesn't change the lived experience of those who aren't truly reflected in these forms. Questionnaires need to ask the right questions if they want to capture what's really happening in the world. A Northern African non-binary person might be misgendered or considered white by the census, but face disproportional discrimination, health disparities or language barriers that are unique to their community. It's no wonder, then, that it's often marginalized and vulnerable communities ones whose identities are missing from these forms that lack access to governmental resources and protections. Now, there are some understandable historical reasons why people might not want to engage in this kind of data gathering. But without the data, it’s just easier to deny the inequality is real. If we want a more equitable society, we have to measure our reality, and the best way to start is by using language that recognizes our differences."
9:38,Rebecca Galemba,How employers steal from workers — and get away with it,Sep 2021,"When you work, you expect to be paid for it. You don't expect to be paid less than you were promised or worse, nothing at all. But that's exactly what's happening to millions of Americans who work in a range of industries. It's especially a problem in agriculture, construction, restaurants, garment factories, poultry plants, nursing homes, in day labor and among independent contractors. It's called wage theft, and chances are that you or someone you know has experienced it. Wage theft occurs when individuals do not receive their legally owed wages and benefits. Wage theft can take many forms: Paying below the minimum wage, withholding earned benefits, overtime, breaks or tips, misclassifying employees as independent contractors and even outright non-payment. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that workers are losing 50 billion dollars a year to wage theft, but most people haven't even heard of the problem. If it's hard to picture 50 billion dollars, consider this. Yearly economic losses to auto theft, robbery and burglary combined come to much less at 14 billion a year. Wage theft impacts more than just the workers who don't get their wages. It lowers wages in those workplaces and across entire industries. Plus, it robs communities of tax dollars. And even more broadly, it rewards cheating, undermines competition and creates a race to the bottom that hurts us all. Although wage theft impacts many industries, my research focuses on one of the most vulnerable sectors, day laborers, most of whom are immigrants from Latin America who seek daily work for cash. You may have seen day laborers at a worker center, outside a home improvement store or on a street corner. On a typical morning at a street corner hiring site, trucks screech to a halt and employers yell out how many workers they need and the pay rate and workers rush to the passenger-side window. Day laborers may just have a couple of minutes to negotiate their wages, hours and working conditions, all in competition with other workers and frequently with limited English proficiency. This rapid pace of the hiring process, unstable work, lack of immigration status and working on one of the least regulated sectors of the economy makes day laborers particularly vulnerable to wage theft, as well as other forms of exploitation, harassment and victimization. Since 2015, my research has focused on immigrant day laborers' experiences with wage theft in Colorado. I've also trained teams of graduate students as field workers and taken them out to street corners and Denver's worker center El Centro Humanitario. In total, we interviewed 170 day laborers and conducted a follow-up survey of over 400. Day laborer Bernal's story demonstrates how wage theft happens. Bernal was recruited at a street corner hiring site in Denver, Colorado, by an employer who then drove him 70 miles away for a construction project. Bernal worked from nine in the morning until late at night. When the work was completed, his employer didn't pay him. What's more, he stranded him in the parking lot over an hour from home. The employer told him, ""Tomorrow I'll come back and pay you, I didn't bring any money."" When Bernal insisted on being paid, the employer relented and gave me a check. But when Bernal went to cash that check, it had no funds. So then he was stuck with a bounced check fee on top of his unpaid wages. Bernal's story shows the many ways employers try to cheat workers out of their wages. They strand them far from home. They promise to pay later. They claim they don't have the money to pay. Or they issue checks with insufficient funds. Employers often say that wage theft is an accident, but day laborers’ experiences show how it’s a patterned and intentional practice to benefit at worker's expense. Sadly, Bernal's story is not unique. My survey results found that 62 percent of day laborers had experienced wage theft and 19 percent just in the six months prior to being surveyed. When day laborers try to confront employers for their unpaid wages, they may stop answering the phone, change their numbers or even threaten the worker. Because day laborers work informally and off the books, some employers, they claim to have never hired the worker at all. Some employers vaguely or even directly threaten to call immigration when workers speak up or complain. This is illegal, but employers get away with it anyway. That's because retaliation protections are weak and immigrant day laborers don't tend to come forward because they don't trust the system to protect them. US wage and hour laws require employers to pay wages for all work completed, regardless of legal status. Otherwise, there's a perverse incentive to cheat. However, the labor rights enforcement system is under-resourced and largely depends on individuals to come to it to pursue cases. That's a big ask for anyone and especially for vulnerable populations like day laborers. Not only does it take a good amount of legal knowledge to even know where to begin, but there's also a steep opportunity cost. Day laborers worry about spending days, weeks, months, even years, chasing unpaid wages, when they could just be out working the next job. They also worry about retaliation. That's why many workers never file or give up their claims. As many workers said, they don't want to go around fighting. So wage theft continues because employers know they're likely to get away with it. That doesn't mean that day laborers do nothing to prevent wage theft or try to upgrade their working conditions. At street corners, day laborers try to organize a wage floor to prevent undercutting and warn workers of employers with bad reputations when they walk by. For example, they shout, ""This one doesn't pay"" to blacklist employers who mistreated workers in the past. Other strategies include only accepting cash, not cheques, and insisting on getting paid every day, rather than waiting for employers who promise to pay at the end of the week or even bimonthly. Still, day laborers recognize that due to lack of work and employer's relative power over them, that there's no guarantee. Only half of day laborers who had experienced wage theft did anything to recover their unpaid wages, including even asking their employer for the money they owed them. Just a third took the additional step of seeking assistance from others. As many workers told me and student researchers, there's nothing you can do. Every year, when I collaborate with students on this project, some students tell me that they realize that they too have experienced wage theft. They're in quite different positions than immigrant day laborers, but also work in industries that are prone to wage theft, such as childcare, restaurants, bars and in low-paying and unpaid internships. In fact, half a million Coloradans suffer wage theft every year. The nature of work is changing. We've seen it in the rise of freelancing, independent contracting, piece rate and part-time work and contingent work. Not only has there been a resurgence of day labor, but more jobs look increasingly a lot like day labor, even if that's not what we would call them. Of course, there's a lot of flexibility and competitiveness that comes from these new kinds of jobs. But there also can be risks when they're also increasingly characterized by low pay, no benefits, job insecurity, lack of employer responsibility and are primed for labor violations like wage theft. They may be further prone to labor practices that are quite harmful and humiliating, but perfectly legal. US labor laws are still based on relatively traditional definitions and relationships between employers and their employees. Work arrangements that increasingly carve workers out of employee status, not only lessen employer's responsibilities, but make it all the more challenging to hold them accountable for labor violations, as well as unsafe working conditions. Wage theft is not exceptional. It's just one more way we've undermined workers in the name of profit and flexibility. It's critical to update labor rights enforcement to better evolve towards the changing nature of work. But that's not enough. We also need to rethink and upgrade employment so that people's work can actually support their lives. And when we look for contractors to remodel our homes, look for childcare or eat out in restaurants, we need to ask more questions, not just about the quality of a job or a service, or even where the ingredients in our food come from, but also attuned to how workers are being paid and being treated. When we see rapid construction growth in our cities, we see signs of development and of progress. But we should also ask for whom and at what cost. The insecurity and risks of day labor should worry all of us, about the future of work. Unless we transform our approach to whose lives and labor matter. Thank you."
5:39,Pekka Hämäläinen,The rise and fall of the Lakota Empire,Sep 2021,"In 1776, a powerful empire was born in North America. The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted buffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota,  control of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power in the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying for power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations,  or seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests and wetlands between the Great Lakes  and the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers destabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading furs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range of the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s, they turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile and abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water was immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became  skilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes of maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting to find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls  to the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating up the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let them pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning of a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women processed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns, ammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox vaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged other Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired the Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement  between two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas and 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military might was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory presented a huge expense, and once there they would face  formidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford  and wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease  the Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition  and rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans in North America were being forced off their lands  and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled  some 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly across this vast area, moving their villages  in pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates,  came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex diplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies  that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit, and kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory and disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended  to respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains and government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud negotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs  Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne  and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations  against the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied  the sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas,  this was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull,  Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans  in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where US officials murdered  Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture,  prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement called the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890, the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children, at Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight  for their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline  through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government known for breaking its promises."
5:08,Dan Sayers,The secret society of the Great Dismal Swamp,Aug 2021,"Straddling Virginia and North Carolina is an area that was once described as the “most repulsive of American possessions.” By 1728, it was known  as the Great Dismal Swamp. But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that  a hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there?  And what happened to them? People long suspected that communities had settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first systematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been extensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented many practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate thorny thickets, wade through waters studded with sinkholes, and braved the threats  of dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found islands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed traces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings  that appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits,  and basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems  to have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and  fragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined with previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches far back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly inhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE,  before it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began much later. In the early 1600′s, more  Indigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century, it seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery— began entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings support the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home  to the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival  depended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely self-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated grains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more  from the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably already decomposed by the time archaeologists came to investigate. But researchers were able to find  more durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were  likely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified  by others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century, It seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community  and the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began encroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and enslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood, excavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s  hidden communities might have switched to a more  defensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more  mass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret  Swamp communities dispersed during or soon after  the American Civil War, by the end of which slavery was abolished in the United States. Some people may have stayed in the Swamp until they passed away or left to settle elsewhere. Most of what we know about these hidden communities has come to light after archeologists excavated sections of a single island. However, there may have been hundreds of habitable islands dotting the Swamp’s interior at the time. Between 1600 and 1860, many people lived  in these hidden settlements. Some probably lived their entire lives within the Swamp and never saw a white person  or experienced racial persecution in broader American society. Generations of Black Maroons  and Indigenous Americans resisted slavery and colonization  by creating an independent society in the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp. They fostered a refuge in what might seem  like the unlikeliest of places— but one that was more hospitable than what lay outside. Today, this area offers a partial record of that secret, self-reliant world, imagined and built for survival  and the preservation of freedom."
10:21,Candis Watts Smith,3 myths about racism that keep the US from progress,Jul 2021,"When I’m out at the grocery store or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son -- he’s six and a half -- people will stop us and mention that they think that he’s handsome. I agree. They'll use that opportunity to chop it up with him, and often when they're done talking with him, they’ll mention that they think he’s a smart and engaging little guy. When those people walk away, the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man. This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race and racism in the United States, and this kind of work can produce feelings of pessimism. One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have an orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate the distance between where we were and where we are now. But that same orientation can blind us from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be. The other thing I’ve learned about Americans is that we have a very, very narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South. And this really narrow definition can constrain our opportunities to produce a more racially egalitarian society. We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that we might just need to look in the mirror. Now, I'm not saying that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality. Some people say, “Well, you do all this work about racism. What’s the answer?” And I say that the first thing we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place. History shows that racists have had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are and what racism is, and it’s never them or the things that they do. But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant fear of their children’s lives. I'd like to dispel three myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region. But there are other states and regions that are competing for the title. For example, if we look at the most segregated states in terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South. There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast. They're where we live. Or if we look at states with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them are in the South. They're where we live. My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery of racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated the most racially negative attitudes. But this geography has evolved, and things have changed. By 2016, we found that the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the ""most prejudiced population"" titles. Now, I'm not saying that one state is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own special brand of racism. And it doesn't have to be like this. Most of the inequalities that we see in our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level. What that means is that we don't have to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities. We can simply hold our city, our county, our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes. Myth two: we're not that good at hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor of Virginia did blackface, and people were like, ""Oh, that's bad. I need to get that racist out of here""? I was giving y'all the side-eye, and here's why. While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into the current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did blackface but didn't get caught. So, how many of us might have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods secede from their district so that kids could go to all-white schools -- in the 21st century? Or how many of us might have supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced some groups' chances of voting? Or how many of us might have focused on the behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care systems and policies when we learn about the huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality? It doesn't have to be like this. We could do something different. We could scrutinize the behaviors of the rule makers. We could orient ourselves toward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical policy solutions. Myth three: If you believe that when all the grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work of eradicating racism, but there are some things that we should note. We know that young folks, young white folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it, they're looking for it. But we also know that they don't live diverse lives. Research shows that the average white American literally has one black friend. And what that means is that most don't have any at all. Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors who aren't white. My research with Professor Christopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials their racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes, just as in other times, even more racially conservative than boomers. When we ask them about the things that are important to them, they don't have any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality. How did we get like this? Well, one of the things we might think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems that we want them to solve. Research shows that white parents in particular will either choose to not talk about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them from a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce negative racial attitudes. So it's kind of like how some of your parents might have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about the birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots and then you did it all wrong. It's like that. It doesn't have to be like this. We can do better. We can have hard conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism makes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past. Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live in a post-racial world? Well, I say that it's time for us to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like to live in a post-racist world. But in order to do that, we'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism -- not just in the matter of hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again to marginalize some people -- and agree to become anti-racists -- people who learn more and do better. So we could ask harder questions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw our full weight behind them. We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align with our values. We could talk to our kids about racism. We could figure out our state's special brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities, and people can unmake them. And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us to do nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)"
18:07,Sean Sherman,Why aren't there more Native American restaurants?,Jul 2021,"Hi there, my name is Sean Sherman, I am a chef. Unfortunately, I don't have food for you guys tonight. Food for thought, I guess, maybe. I'm here to talk about Native American food. I was born and raised in Pine Ridge in South Dakota, and our focus are on Indigenous foods. And, you know, it's been a really interesting journey so far. I started my company called The Sioux Chef -- S-I-O-U-X, a little play on words -- back in 2014. But it had come from quite a few years of trying to research and understand because I kind of grew up in restaurants. I grew up in Pine Ridge. I grew up in Spearfish and in South Dakota in the Black Hills. And I started working a lot of touristy restaurants. And, you know, I had just a long career. All through high school and college, I worked restaurants. After college, I moved to Minneapolis. I became a chef at a young age in the city. And I'd just been cheffing for a long time. And a few years into my chef career, I realized the complete absence of Indigenous foods. And even for myself, I realized that I couldn't even name -- I could name less than a handful of Lakota recipes that were truly Lakota, things without cream of mushroom soup in it, right? (Laughter) So I was really trying -- It, you know, put me on a path to try and understand what happened, like where are all the Native American foods at, you know? And so it's been really interesting. So Indigenous foods, that shouldn't be -- there shouldn't be a big question mark, you know, we should know about it, because no matter where we are in North America, we're -- you know, North America obviously begins, all of its history begins with Indigenous history, right? And no matter where we are, we're standing on indigenous land. And so we should have a really good, strong sense of Native American food because it's just the land that we're on. It's just the history of the land that we're on. So for us, it became more than just serving foods. It really became talking about it and talking about why it isn't here. And I think it's a really important story for us to know. And it's also really important to see the benefit of why understanding Indigenous foods could really help all of us in the future. So, you know, but where are all the Native American restaurants? We live in a world today, you know, where we have -- as the US, we’re like food capitals of the world, right? We have some of the best restaurants in New York City, in Chicago and LA, and zero Indigenous restaurants that are focused on the land that they're sitting on, which is kind of insane. You can have every other restaurants -- and Indian restaurants don't count, because that was my only choice on Facebook, because when I was trying to decide how to describe our restaurant -- is it Indian or is it new American or old American? But anyways, so what we've done is like we tried to focus on, first off, just understanding what were precontact foods, precolonial foods. And I realized that that term didn't even really make a lot of sense to people. So I think it's really important to go through the storyline because to understand colonial or what is a precolonial food, you have to understand colonialism itself. And to understand colonialism, the easiest way is just to Google it. So if you Google the word ""colonialism,"" you'll get a definition, ""it's a policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers and exploiting it economically."" And this is something that's happened not uniquely here. It's happened all across the globe. So all over the Americas, North and South, all over Africa, all over India, all over Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, you name it, like this has been a very common history for a lot of areas around the globe. For the US, which is our focus, because we're right here smack dab in the middle of the United States, it's really important to understand the history because the US did a really good job of smudging its history a little bit. So if you're going through high school, the history you get on Indigenous peoples probably isn't the best history. So you really should read a little bit more about what really happened. So let's start with Manifest Destiny, which is really kind of something that was born from the idea of what was originally doctrine of discovery, which basically gave European powers their own rights to say, if we discover it, then we own it. Right? But that policy doesn't really work that well, because if you go into an Apple Store and you discover a brand new MacBook, most likely you're not going to have the rights to walk out the door with it. But a lot of our policies and a lot of -- like, our country was built on this notion that we just have this right to everything, right? And people have to remember how young our history is. We're such a young country, you know? There's like, barely any time has passed. So just go back a couple hundred years and, like, start with 1800s. So in 1800, the United States is still not much more than just the 13 colonies at that point in history. And it’s the 1800s that are the most deadly century for Indigenous peoples. So a lot of really bad things happened during this time period, because in 1800, in reality, almost all of what is the US is still completely occupied by Indigenous peoples and communities and a huge diversity of them across the board. Even despite European powers having big land claims, you know, France has a big section and Spain's got big chunks and England is holding on to chunks and Russia is coming in and there's all sorts of just big land grabs happening. But in reality, it's the Indigenous communities that have always been there. But this century is a mass century of change, you know. So during this time period, things move really fast. So this is just a really tough time. And for me, this is like my great-grandfather's era because my great-grandfather was born in the late 1850s and during his lifetime, he sees so much change so quickly, he sees so many battles between the Lakota and the US government. He sees the Battle of Little Bighorn when he's 18 years old, during the battle on the Lakota side. He sees his kids having to go to boarding school, cut their hair, learn to speak English, learn Christianity. He sees his children -- some of his children even grow up to fight for the US government. So it's such a crazy amount of change to see in one single lifetime, right? And during this time period, people are getting pushed around. At the beginning of that century, over 80 percent of that landmass was under Indigenous control. And by the end of the century less than two percent, only because of the reservation systems. And this is all just part of the story of why there aren't Native American restaurants, because we just went through a really traumatic time in history where we're still -- we haven't even had the time to heal yet, let alone evolve, right, when it comes down to all this. So the US history, you know, there's a lot of these big movements like the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Homestead Act of 1862, the Indian Appropriation Act that basically said we're wards the states, that we're not our own entities anymore, the Dawes Act of 1887. And all these pieces were very focused and the government was really, really good at what they did, you know. And it all starts with taking our food away from us. So the loss of Indigenous food is something that starts from the very beginning. George Washington, one of his very first things that he does is send General Sullivan out to push all the native people outside of the US. He wanted them captured. He wanted them brought back. And they went on this march that lasts a single summer and does just that. So after a single summer, there's no more native people in all of that New York area, from D.C. all the way up, basically. And they named George Washington the president. They gave the name for a US president: Town Destroyer, which is still the name that they use today because he just devastated a whole area. And this is the precedent that gets set for how the US government treats the Indigenous peoples throughout the next century, basically. So here, in our area, the very systematic destruction of bison, which they knew would hurt a lot of people, and it did. And by the end of the century, there was less than 500 on the planet. And it was very purposeful. So ... But I think what's most damaging for us and why we don't have a lot of Indigenous restaurants out there was the loss of our education, because this whole generation, like my great-grandfather's generation and my grandfather's generation especially, like, those generations should have been getting the full extent of Indigenous education. They should have been learning everything their ancestors intended them to learn. How to fish, how to hunt, how to gather, how to identify plants, how to live sustainably, utilising plants and animals around us. But instead, we went through a really intense assimilation period where we basically, you know, the boarding school systems stripped this whole generation of all that knowledge and education. And it became very traumatic because this was not a fun situation for these kids to go through. This was a military-style school and they popped up all over the US, all over Canada. These kids being again forced to speak different languages, forced to learn new religions, forced to learn skills that had nothing to do with them. And being forced to is the situation. You know, a lot of these kids perished. We shouldn't have to worry about sending kids to school to see if they'll survive or not. But this was a very harsh situation for kids to go through. And they went through physical abuse, sexual abuse. They went through mental abuse. And we're still reeling from that in our communities today because of this direct link to the trauma that happened there. And being Indigenous in the 1900s wasn't much better. My grandparents were born before they were even citizens, which doesn't happen until 1924. And then in the 40s and 60s, the US government started dismantling a lot of tribes. So over 100 tribes got dismantled so they could continue to take over more land spaces. We couldn't vote until 1965. We couldn't celebrate religions until '78, you know. So what does it look like for me growing up in this? I was born in the mid-70s and growing up in postcolonial America. Like, what kind of foods was I eating? And I get asked that a lot because people in the media are always like, ""You're native, like what kind of foods did you grow up with?"" Because they want to hear a cool story like, ""I'd get up in the morning, take down an elk with a slingshot, we'd have a big family feast."" But that wasn't the reality, because like I grew up with the Commodity Food Program because we were poor, like a lot of people on the reservation. And we didn't even have the pretty cans when I was growing up. We just had, you know, these black and white cans, beef with juices. And that's dinner, you know, and that sucks. So ... And Indian tacos, you know, even when I was a kid, I was like, why does our Lakota food taste like Mexican food? It didn't even make sense to me at the time. Because we could do better than this. There's so much more to learn and more to offer with indigenous foods. So it’s really important to understand what Indigenous foods are. But first, you have to understand just like how diverse our nation is. We're so diverse, there's all sorts of plants and animals out there. And when you layer Indigenous peoples on it, you can see so much amazing diversity, you know? This is a language map. So just look at all those huge color blocks and within those color blocks there's all sorts of diversity within those two, right? Still today, we have 634 tribes in Canada, 573 in the US and 20 percent of Mexico identifies as Indigenous. So there's an immense amount of indigeneity out there today and we should be celebrating that diversity because it's awesome. You know, just compare colonial settler states to Indigenous territories and you can see that diversity. It should change everywhere we go. You know, the US, the food system shouldn't just be hamburgers across the board, or in Canada shouldn't just be poutine. We could do so much better describing our foods, right? And so we have to really focus on Indigenous education because it's important for us to learn. So when we're looking at Indigenous education, it's a study of all these pieces, wild food, permaculture, native agriculture, seed saving, seasonal lifestyles, ethno-oceanography, hunting, fishing, whole animal butchery, mycology, salt, sugar and fat productions, crafting, land stewardship, cooking, metallurgy, Indigenous history, traditional medicines, food preservation, fermentation, nutrition, health, spirituality, gender roles, sustainability -- all of that stuff is this really important education that we need to learn, you know. So let's just break down some foods real quick. Proteins are easy. We learn about how natives were able to use every single part of a bison. But that's just because we didn't have the privilege to be wasteful. We figured out how to be resourceful with everything that we had and we treated everything like that. But basically, anything moving around is literally game. And we cut out beef, pork and chicken because those animals didn't exist here. And there are other animals to eat out there that aren't those three. So there's just a ton of stuff out there. And you shouldn't be afraid of something if it's not a cow, a pig or a chicken because there's a lot of cool foods out there, and even insects, it's so normal in so many parts of the world and it was normal here, too. But for us, our biggest love is plant knowledge because you start to learn the plants around us, you just see food and medicine everywhere. The Western diet has never really taken the time to learn this amazing biology that surround us and all these plants all around us. Because there's so much to learn. There's all sorts of staples out there, like the timpsula, which is the prairie turnip which grows around these plains. Camas root from the Pacific Northwest, wild rice from the Great Lakes, even just seaweed out there in the oceans, which a lot of families were utilizing, or in the deserts where all the plants look like they want to hurt you or maim you. The Indigenous peoples knew how to live with them. And another piece like the domesticated piece, with all the agriculture, it's really important, because we think of this as agriculture but we know how damaging this is. And it's scary when you see headlines like, ""What should we do if glyphosate was found in our Cheerios?"" You guys should be really scared about that. That stuff's really nasty, you know. But it's just amazing to learn about Indigenous agriculture because it goes back so far and people figured out all sorts of ways to farm and build sustained, huge civilisations, whether they're in the middle of the desert, whether they're on the coastal regions, or way up here in the Dakotas. People were able to farm amazing things that had an amazing amount of diversity that we need to protect. We are the stewards of what's left of this diversity. And a lot of it got wiped off the map in the 1800s with all that colonialism that was going on. So we have to be understanding so we can protect these for the next generation because these could disappear if we don't do anything about it. So it's really important to understand that. So to use Indigenous knowledge in today's world, it's just important to open up your eyes, you know, stop calling everything a weed because that just means you don't know what it is. You know, our kids can name more K-Pop bands than they can trees and that's your fault, you know? (Laughter) We need to teach them things that are important. Because, like, just look around. There's food everywhere and we should be making pantries, like our grandparents did, and our great-grandparents. They just used the food that was around us. So we should just be making our own pantries that tastes like where we are, what makes us unique in our own region. And that's why we should have Native American food restaurants all over the nation, run by Indigenous peoples. There's so much to explore. There's so much flavor. There's so much health. And it's just super healthy, you know, and it's fun for chefs to create and play with all these flavors. Chefs should be really excited about getting to learn all of these plants that aren't in their diet because they're just going out of a French cookbook. And for us, we just want to get this food back into tribal communities especially, and make people healthy and happy and break a lot of the cycle of, you know, government reliance on food and huge rates of type 2 diabetes and obesity and heart disease because of this low nutritional food base that the government's been feeding us for too long. And we just need to think about how we can adjust and make a better lifestyle. We need to use our land spaces better. Lawns are fucking stupid. (Laughter) We need to really do something better. We could just be growing food out there, you know? We could just be putting food plants everywhere. We need more community gardens, more permacultural landscapes. It's that easy. If we can grow 30 golf courses in Palm Springs in the middle of the desert, just think what we could do if we just did that for good and just put food everywhere, you know? An organic food, food that wants to grow in that certain region. So, you know, Indigenous diet is really the most ideal diet. It's healthy fats. It's diverse proteins, it's low carbs, it's low salt. It's a ton of plant diversity. It's organic agriculture. It's celebrating cultural and regional diversity. And it's seasonal. It's just really good. It's like what the paleo diet wishes it was, when it comes down to it, because that just makes sense, you know, and we need to protect this. We need to get this out there. And again, it's not unique here. There's Indigenous peoples all around the world and there's an Indigenous knowledge base that's basically untapped because of the colonial structure that's been put everywhere. We need to be protecting people in Africa and India and Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, South America, North America. We need to protect those. We need to be celebrating diversity instead of trying to build stupid walls to keep people out. We need to have, you know, healthy food access, cultural food producers, regional food systems, local control of food systems, not governmental control, access to Indigenous education and environmental protections to protect a lot of this natural food that surround us. We need to be better connected to our nature around us and really, truly understand how it's a symbiotic relationship. We're not above it, right? If we can control our food, we can control our future. And for us, it's an exciting time to be Indigenous because we are taking all of these lessons from our ancestors that should have been passed down to us, relearning them and utilizing the world today with everything it has to offer and becoming something different. We're at the stage where we're ready to evolve. This is an Indigenous evolution and revolution at the same time. So I hope someday that you can drive across this nation, stop at Indigenous-run food businesses and see this amazing amount of diversity out there and just think about it, you know."
5:39,Robert Chang,The dark history of the Chinese Exclusion Act,Jul 2021,"After 12 years living in California, Chinese citizen Chae Chan Ping was ready for a visit home. He procured the necessary documents  for his departure and return journey, and set sail for China, where he spent the next year  reconnecting with friends and family. But when he returned to San Francisco  on October 8th, 1888, Ping and his fellow immigrant passengers were forbidden to disembark. Just days earlier, President Grover Cleveland had signed the Scott Act, which invalidated the legal documents allowing their re-entry to the United States. This policy threatened  to separate families and deprive Chinese immigrants  of their homes and livelihoods. Ping challenged the ruling, beginning a legal battle for the rights of thousands of Chinese immigrants. But his case inspired an even more controversial policy that continues to impact immigrants  around the globe. Discrimination against Chinese immigrants had begun decades earlier, when the California Gold Rush created a massive demand for labor. Initially, Chinese immigrants were welcomed as reliable workers and became essential parts of frontier communities. Many built railroads  and worked in the mines, while others operated laundries, restaurants, and general stores. The 1868 Burlingame Treaty even granted China favored trading status with the US, and allowed unrestricted migration between the two countries. But as large numbers of Chinese immigrants found success, American workers began  to see them as a threat. Politicians and labor leaders denounced them for driving down wages, and violence against Chinese individuals became increasingly common. This anti-Chinese sentiment soon found  its way into California’s courts. In 1854, following a murder trial where  a white man was convicted of murdering a Chinese man, the California Supreme Court  overturned the conviction, holding that Chinese eyewitness testimony was inadmissible. The court declared that Chinese citizens could not testify against  white defendants, citing similar precedents  forbidding testimony by Black and Native American individuals. This decision effectively  legalized violence against California’s Chinese population, inspiring mob attacks and campaigns for segregation. Before long, anti-Chinese sentiment reached the federal level. In 1882, Congress passed  the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first federal law that restricted immigration based explicitly on nationality. In practice, the Act banned entry  to all ethnically Chinese immigrants besides diplomats, and prohibited existing immigrants from obtaining citizenship. It also meant Chinese individuals couldn’t leave the United States and return without first applying for a certificate  of re-entry. This policy remained in place  until October 1st, 1888, when the Scott Act prohibited re-entry altogether, stranding Chae Chan Ping and thousands of other Chinese immigrants. In court, Ping argued he had followed  the proper protocol obtaining his re-entry certificate, and the government had not honored his legally issued document. This argument was strong enough to send his case all the way to the Supreme Court. But the justices ruled against Ping, invalidating thousands of legal re-entry certificates in one fell swoop. The decision led to Ping’s deportation and left up to 20,000 Chinese immigrants unable to return to the US. But arguably even more important  than the court’s racist ruling was the logic they used to support it. Traditionally, the Supreme Court is considered a check on the other two branches  of American government, offering judgment on policies passed by Congress and the president. In this case however, the court stated they had no power  to pass judgment on the Scott Act, since Congress had declared  the immigration policy “a matter of national security.” This decision set a unique precedent. Unless Ping's case was overturned, congressional and executive branches could claim national security concerns to pass whatever immigration laws they wanted. Throughout the 20th century, xenophobic government officials used  this power to freely discriminate against immigrant groups. The 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone Act  prohibited the entry of all South Asians. And a series of immigration acts  in the 1920s expanded restrictions throughout Asia,  Eastern Europe and southern Europe. Many of these restrictions were lifted after World War II, and the Chinese Exclusion Act itself was finally repealed in 1943— over 60 years after it was enacted. But the US government continues  to use this precedent to deploy sudden and sweeping  immigration policies, targeting journalists and dissidents  as well as ethnic groups. Little is known about what became of  Chae Chan Ping following his deportation. But the injustices visited upon him  and thousands of other Chinese Americans continue to impact immigrant rights  and liberties."
10:32,Khadijah Tribble,"How marijuana reform could repair, reclaim and restore communities",Jun 2021,"""What did you want to be when you grow up"" is a question that I'm sure many of you have heard in your childhood. But if your upbringing was anything like mine, it is a question that you heard over and over again. And it wasn't until I became an adult that I began to understand the significance of the asking of the questions by our community leaders and my grandparents. But it was only recently in the last two years that I get some true understanding of just how much significance and weight there was in the answer back then and even today. You see, growing up Black and female in the South more than 40 years ago, there are some limitations to the answer to that question. Whether real or perceived, there were limitations all the same. And so what I want you to understand at this moment, as a young girl growing up, with all that was happening right after the civil rights movement, all of the advancements of the struggle, things that were meant to push and advance the African-American community; things like the Voting Rights Act, The Fair Housing Act and affirmative action, and my generation was supposed to be taking full advantage of all of those opportunities. So, when they ask the question, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?,"" it meant something to them. I remember hearing this question one summer at vacation Bible school. And if anybody is here from the South, you understand that vacation Bible school is not to be confused with BTU training school or Sunday-go-to-meeting school. it is vacation Bible school. I'm still trying to figure out who thought it was a good idea to put a vacation, Bible and school all together ... (Laughter) But the first week of every summer, of every summer during my childhood, it was spent in vacation Bible school. And this one particular summer there was a teacher. She wasn't too much older than me and my middle school friends. She wanted to make sure that we understood scripture and was able to connect it to this real world question of what you will be when you grow up. And so as my gaggle of girls sat around lunch that day, trying to figure out what we were going to say, thinking back now, it was a really impressive group of girls because they wanted to be things like civil rights attorneys, educators and doctors. I didn't want any of that. I was going to do something different. You see, I was going to be ... wait for it ... A thinker. (Laughter) Yes. (Applause) So when it came time for me to take the stage and share with the entire vacation Bible school, I introduced myself and I said, ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a thinker."" There was some laughter, some giggles, but it was really the disapproving look on the teacher's face that made me recant. And so I said really quickly, ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a lawyer,"" and then I exit stage left. But fast-forward to two years ago and I get an opportunity to spend time at an institution known for creating and cultivating great thinkers. Little did I know at the time that there's a ritual at the Kennedy School where students get an opportunity to stand on the famous forum stage and they're given 15 seconds to say what they were going to do at the Kennedy School. And so, you know what I'm thinking, right? It's a full-circle moment. I'm going to get it right. So I take the mic, I introduce myself and I say to my peers, to deans and to faculty members that I'm here to tell you that marijuana matters. Not a lot of giggles. Actually, it was actually a lot of applause. But in my head, I'm thinking, ""Khadijah, did you just stand on the premiere policy stage and tell these folks you’re going to talk about weed?” (Laughter) That's exactly what I did, and for the next 12 months, I immersed myself in all things marijuana, day in and day out, reading, talking, sniffing, thinking about marijuana. So much so, my lovely wife Robyn banned the topic from the dinner table. (Laughter) But here's what I came to understand about marijuana. And if you don't remember anything else from my talk, please remember this. That for all of the gains that we were trying to make with the civil rights movement -- fair housing, expanded opportunities in education, employment opportunities, building the wealth of the African-American community, the failed policies of the war on drugs single-handedly undid all of that. (Applause) And here's how we know that. I want to give you guys five numbers. Five. Seven. 46. 23 and one. And no, it's not the Mega Millions jackpot numbers. See, for more than five decades, this country has waged a war on drugs, which has been tantamount to waging a war on Black and brown communities. Millions of people have been arrested, convicted and incarcerated for marijuana-related possessions. In the last decade alone, 7 million. And those 7 million people are facing what's known as 46,000 collateral consequences. Now, some of you may be saying, ""If you do the crime, you do the time."" And I only have five minutes left, so I can't argue that point today. But I will say to you, at this moment, when 33 states and the District of Columbia have some form of regulated growing marijuana, selling marijuana, consuming marijuana and distributing marijuana on a mass scale, is it still a crime? I ask because I've met people all across this country who are living with those collateral consequences. People like Keyvette, a young woman, very energetic about her future. When she left high school, she was ambitious and she wanted to go off to college. But before she could realize that she was stopped for a routine traffic violation, I think it was a broken headlight. And in the course of that stop the police officers smelled marijuana. And if you're in the state of Virginia, the smell of marijuana is probable cause for search and seizure. The car was searched, there was marijuana that wasn't used. She was arrested, booked, and to this day, she still has a criminal record related to marijuana. Because of that record, she often finds it hard to qualify for an apartment, employment opportunities. She also lost the opportunity to use financial aid to go to school. Some of you might not even know there are about 26 licensures for entry-level employment opportunities, that if you have a marijuana-related conviction, you may not be able to get that license, like a barber's license or a cosmetology license. But the thing that I find so offensive about ??? situation is that she has two kids. And there's evidence to suggest children born to individuals who have a marijuana-related offense, they're more likely to live in poverty. And I ask you guys, is that fair? Is that equitable? Or take the veteran who proudly and honorably served for 26 years in the United States Air Forces. In that service, he actually lost the use of his legs, he's paralyzed and he uses marijuana for pain management. He also uses it to deal with his anxiety and depression that you can imagine would come with losing independence and mobility. And he uses marijuana knowing full well that he is at risk of losing the very health benefits that he earned as a disabled veteran. You know, people ask me all the time, ""Khadijah, why marijuana? Why are you so passionate  about marijuana?” The reality of it is I feel like this is just a continuation of the work I've done my entire life. I've worked alongside marginalized communities, in service of marginalized communities in hopes that I would be able to improve their life in some way. But if I'm being honest and frank, it's also very personal to me, marijuana is a personal issue for me. You see, that veteran happens to be my father, Retired Master Sergeant Willie B. Tribble, and I will fight for his right and the thousands of other veterans to get the life saving -- and we don't know that yet by research, but I suggest that it could potentially be -- medicine that is quality and safe for veterans. And Keyvette?  Keyvette is my daughter in law. And those two kids, King and Titan, mean so much to me. And just like my grandparents asked me, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?,"" I want to be able to hear from my grandsons: anything they want to be. Thank you for listening."
4:46,Meg Jacobs,"What few people know about the program that ""saved"" America",Jun 2021,"In 1932, the Great Depression entered its third winter. One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate in the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost  their homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that Republican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked  to his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised a New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation  to support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt proposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed many Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency  with public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s first hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful  of any US president. In just over three months, he pushed  over 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup”  of government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was stabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years,  many Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose  their money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight of commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee that any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s need for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford groceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving planting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address  the New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was established to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation,  and fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter,  and education to those employed; mostly young, single men  with families in need of relief. Subsequent programs  like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges,  and hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing, and theater programs. These initiatives cut  civilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts  that abolished child labor, granted unions the right  to collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help  those unable to work. The Social Security Act established  an old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance,  disability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups more than others. Black Americans were hit hardest by the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact  on Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of  jobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than one million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received an influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support  of Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development  but fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants  and agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also undermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting a federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been called a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing,  employment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs  prioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal  didn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing  over 8 million Americans, unemployment never went lower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully recover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign  of progressive policies did empower unions to start  their own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals,  Black Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped the Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork  for an emerging civil rights coalition."
5:07,Susan M. Reverby,Ugly History: The US syphilis experiment,Jun 2021,"In the 1930s, the United States was ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes  that persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage syphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders, and even blindness. It was incredibly difficult  to slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be passed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments like mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best and potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals  are classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still  uncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care  professionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant  the risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race change how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced syphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems of Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service  was determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed a small hospital, and the area was home to a large population of potential participants. The PHS collaborated  with local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed  to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men  for their control group. But their recruitment plan centered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe  how syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive  free drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men existing treatments, but these were soon replaced with placebos. Under the false pretense of providing a special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive spinal taps to investigate the disease’s  neurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS would swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange for autopsies. In their published studies, they listed  the men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which they’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment  was advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin  effectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were determined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories about racial difference, and they believed they would never have another opportunity to observe the long-term effects  of untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold knowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced the local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting  and potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued through the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help manage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study  without a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century, this practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies  in Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, and mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections  to study potential treatments. And other studies throughout  the 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting  to these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer  named Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider  ending the study. But after leadership decided against it,  Buxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee study made headlines across the country. Following public outcry, a federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972— 40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment  for syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference was discovered. When the study ended, only 74  of the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children had contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands and fathers. In the wake of this tragedy,  and concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations  for ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate medical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change,  better access to care, and transparency in research  remains urgent."
5:07,Orisanmi Burton,What really happened during the Attica Prison Rebellion,May 2021,"“We are men. We are not beasts and we do not intend  to be beaten or driven as such... What has happened here  is but the sound before the fury of those who are oppressed.” These words were spoken during  the 1971 Attica Prison Rebellion by one of its leaders, Elliott Barkley. At the time, Attica prison was severely overcrowded. Its majority Black and Latino population faced constant physical and verbal abuse. All prison guards were white. Some were members  of white supremacist hate groups. Guards threw away letters  that weren’t written in English and prohibited Muslim religious services. They punished white prisoners  for fraternizing with non-white men. Prisoners were allowed one shower a week and one roll of toilet paper a month. Among those imprisoned at Attica were  Elliott Barkley, Frank Smith, and Herbert X. Blyden. “I’m dying here little by little  every day...” Barkley wrote his mother. She contacted authorities,  but nothing changed. He began writing a book about life at Attica. Meanwhile, Smith worked a position  called the “warden’s laundry boy” for 30 cents day. His grandmother had been enslaved. Because Smith and others were treated  as less-than-human at the will of their keepers, they viewed  prison as an extension of slavery. And Blyden had participated  in prison strikes and rebellions. He and others saw the violence of prison as symptomatic of a societal problem where individuals are denied justice based on their class and race. They felt people shouldn’t be stripped of their rights to health and dignity upon being sentenced. Instead, resources should go towards meeting people’s basic needs to prevent crime in the first place. In the summer of 1971, Blyden co-founded  the Attica Liberation Faction. The group compiled a manifesto and petitioned  Corrections Commissioner Russell Oswald and Governor Nelson Rockefeller for better treatment. Though largely ignored,  they continued organizing. After activist George Jackson was killed  at a California prison, 700 men at Attica participated  in a silent fast. Just weeks later, on September 9th, a spontaneous uprising began. A group of prisoners overpowered guards, sparking the Attica Rebellion. Prisoners broke windows, started fires, and captured supplies. They beat many guards. One of them, William Quinn, would die from his injuries. Soon, over 1,200 prisoners had  assembled in the yard with 42 hostages, preparing to demand change. They established a medical bay,  delegated men to prepare and ration food, protected and sheltered guards,  and elected a negotiating committee. They appointed Blyden chief negotiator, Smith as security chief, and Barkely as a speaker. Later that day, Barkley presented  their demands to the press. When his mother saw him on TV,  she was terrified. He was just days from being released. But she believed authorities  would want retribution. Over the next four days, prisoners held negotiations with officials. They called for a minimum wage, rehabilitation programs, better education, and more. They promised all remaining hostages  would be safe if they were given amnesty  for crimes committed during the uprising. Meanwhile, Governor Rockefeller began crisis talks with President Nixon. The president told his chief of staff that the rebellion should be quelled to set an example  for other Black activists. Commissioner Oswald announced he’d meet a number of the demands, but refused to guarantee amnesty. Prisoners refused to surrender. As warnings of an imminent siege mounted, they threatened to kill 8 hostages  if attacked. Nevertheless, Rockefeller ordered troops to retake the prison. Helicopters tear-gassed the yard. Troopers shot over 2,000 rounds  of ammunition, killing 29 prisoners and 10 guards,  and wounding many others. Witnesses say troopers found Barkley  and shot him in the back. Officers stripped surviving men naked,  tortured them, and deprived them of medical attention. Blyden was starved for days. Smith was sexually violated,  burned with cigarettes, dragged into isolation, and beaten. Directly after the attack,  Governor Rockefeller thought prisoners were responsible for the deaths  of the 10 guards. He called it “a beautiful operation.” President Nixon congratulated Rockefeller and told his chief of staff that the way to stop “radicals”  was to “kill a few.” But autopsies soon confirmed  that prisoners hadn’t killed any guards during  the attack, as threatened. Government forces had. Nixon told Rockefeller  to stand his ground. Those who survived the massacre continued  fighting for revolutionary change. Long after being released, Smith and Blyden campaigned  for social justice and prison abolition. The demands men made at Attica in 1971 remain at the core of ongoing protests— within and beyond prison walls."
5:11,Ilan Stavans,Who decides what's in the dictionary?,May 2021,"“Dictionary:” noun,  “a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language  and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer  of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary  dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published by Robert Cawdrey in 1604. In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written  by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly  showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the  English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version of the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct version of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought  to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time  were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people  actually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and  included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting the English language. But he argued that these words captured local variations of language— a vital part of what made American English unique. He also believed spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way we speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced the words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words  from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft,  mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death,  Noah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought the rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law,  the Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning  of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s opinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather than by a single authority. The current criteria for including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread, sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded  from dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including them might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect changing attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife” as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as  “a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose  gender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong  in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions  are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded  word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users: tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is:  we do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word  or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings are reflected in our dictionaries."
16:49,Katherine M. Gehl,US politics isn't broken. It's fixed,Apr 2021,"Everything I need to know about politics, I learned from cheese. For the last decade of my business career, I ran a 250-million-dollar food company in Wisconsin. And yes, we made cheese. If customers liked my cheese, I did well. If they didn't, they bought cheese from someone else and I did less well. That's healthy competition. Healthy competition incentivizes businesses to make better products. Better products equals happier customers and happier customers equals successful businesses. Win-win. Now, while I was running Gehl Foods, I was also deeply engaged in and increasingly frustrated by politics. The more frustrated I got, the more I wondered why competition in politics didn't deliver the same kind of win-win results. How did the Democrats and the Republicans keep doing so well when their customers, that's us, are so unhappy? Why is the politics industry win-lose? They win. We lose. The answer? It turns out that one thing almost all Americans agree on, ""Washington is broken,"" is also one thing we're all wrong about. Washington isn't broken, it's doing exactly what it's designed to do. It's just not designed to serve us, the citizens, the public interest. Most of the rules in politics are designed and continuously fine-tuned by and for the benefit of private gain-seeking organizations. That's the two parties, a textbook duopoly, and the surrounding companies in the business of politics. And they're all doing great. Even as the American public has never been more dissatisfied. Said another way, politics isn't broken, it's fixed. This is a guiding principle of politics industry theory, the nonpartisan body of work that I originated and have championed over the last seven years. Now, before I go further, I should tell you I'm not on the red team or the blue team. I call myself politically homeless, which may resonate with some of you. And my work doesn't focus blame on individual politicians on either side of the duopoly. The root cause of our political dysfunction, the cause that endures across all election cycles and all administrations is the system, the perverted rules of the game, the rules of the game in politics even make prisoners of our senators and representatives. Their only option is lockstep allegiance to their side of the divide. So what do we do about it? How do we free our Congress and make politics win-win? We change the rules. But which ones? It's not what we think. It's not gerrymandering, not the Electoral College, not the absence of term limits and not even money in politics, really. By looking at the system through a competition lens, politics industry theory identifies the two rules that are both our greatest obstacles and our greatest opportunities. They've been hiding in plain sight. Let's start with bad rule number one: party primaries. You all know primaries, those first round elections that we mostly ignore, the ones that identify the single Republican and the single Democrat who can appear on the November general election ballot. Party primaries have become low turnout elections dominated by highly ideological voters and special interests. Candidates know that the only way to make it to the general election ballot in November is to win the favor of these more extreme partisans in the primary. So candidates from both parties have little choice but to move towards those extremes. Why does this matter? Because it dramatically affects governing, and not in a good way. Imagine you're a member of Congress. You're deciding how to vote on a bipartisan bill that addresses a critical national challenge. You might ask yourself, is this a good idea? Is this what the majority of my constituents want? But that's not how it works in the politics industry. Instead, the question that matters most to you is, will I win my next party primary if I vote for this bill? The answer is almost always no. Consensus solutions don't win party primaries. Let's illustrate this key design flaw with a Venn diagram. In the current system, there's virtually no intersection, no connection between Congress acting in the public interest and the likelihood of their getting reelected. If America's elected representatives do their jobs the way we need them to, they're likely to lose those jobs. That is crazy. No wonder Congress doesn't get anything done. OK, now let's talk about bad rule number two: plurality voting, which I'll explain in just a moment. In any other industry as big and as thriving as politics with this much customer dissatisfaction and only two companies, some entrepreneur would see a phenomenal business opportunity and create a new competitor. But that doesn't happen in politics. Our current parties don't feel competitive pressure to serve the public interest, in large part because of one rule that keeps out almost all new competition: plurality voting. It sounds fancy, but it simply means the candidate with the most votes wins. That also seems logical, but it's a really bad idea. Why? Because in the United States you can win almost any election, even if a majority didn't vote for you. For example, in this three-way race, the winner only has 34 percent of the votes. Sixty-six percent of the voters, most people, wanted someone else. With plurality voting, we may not feel free to vote for the candidate we really want because we're afraid that we'll just waste our vote, or worse, will spoil the election. So if you think back to the 2016 presidential race, voters on the right who liked Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, were told by the Republicans, ""Don't vote for him! He's just a spoiler. He'll take votes away from Trump and help elect Hillary."" And voters on the left who liked Green Party candidate Jill Stein were told by the Democrats, ""Don't vote for her. She's just a spoiler. She'll take votes away from Hillary and help elect Trump."" The spoiler problem that comes from plurality voting is the single biggest reason almost nobody new outside the duopoly ever runs or gets any traction because everyone knows they don't stand a chance. Politics is the only industry where we're regularly told that less competition is better. And if there's never any new competition, the existing parties aren't accountable to us for results because they don't need us to like what they're doing. They only need us to choose one of them as the lesser of two evils or to just stay home. The founders foresaw our situation and they warned us. As when John Adams said, ""There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader and concerting measures in opposition to each other."" Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with parties or even having only two major parties. The problem is the current two are guaranteed to remain the only two, regardless of what they do or don't get done on behalf of the country. Does this sound like the best we can do? Of course not. So the founders gave us what they knew we'd need. They gave us this, our Constitution. There's a reason it's called the pocket Constitution: it's short. Guess what's not in here -- instructions on how to run our elections. Crazy rules like party primaries and plurality voting, they're made up. But thanks to what is in here, Article I, they're optional. Article I gives every state the power to change the rules of election for Congress at any time. Personally, I think it now sounds like the perfect time. And here's where we turn nonpartisan politics industry theory into action. The political innovation we need is what I call final-five voting. With final-five voting, we make two simple changes to our elections for Congress. We get rid of what doesn't work, party primaries and plurality voting, and replace it with what will work: open top-five primaries and instant runoffs in the general election. Let me explain these changes with an example of final-five voting in a hypothetical and kind of cool election. So here we have eight candidates from four different political parties: Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Abigail Adams, all the way through to Aaron Burr, ambitious as ever. Immediately you notice how diverse this field is. It's a primary people would want to vote in because it's exciting. It has experience and vision, but it's also young, scrappy and hungry. OK, maybe not so young. And because this is an open primary, all eight candidates are on the same ballot, regardless of party. When the results are in, the top five finishers move on to the November election, again, regardless of party. In the general election, voters pick their favorite, just like always. But then, if they would like, they can also rank their second, third, fourth and last choices. You may have heard of this idea as ranked-choice voting. Here's where things get interesting. If this election were a plurality vote like normal, Aaron Burr would win because he has the most first-place votes. Thirty percent. But because this is final-five voting, the winner will be the candidate who's most popular with the majority, not just with a narrow slice of voters. So we use instant runoffs. We drop the candidate who came in last and those who had marked that candidate as their first choice get their second choice counted instead. The process continues until a candidate emerges with a majority. It's just like a series of runoffs. But instead of having to keep coming back for another election, voters simply cast all their votes at once. And after those results are in, Alexander Hamilton wins with 68 percent of the vote. Final-five voting is the name for this combination of top-five primaries and instant runoff general elections. We must change both rules at the same time because it's how they work in combination that transforms the incentives in politics. The ultimate purpose of final-five voting is not necessarily to change who wins, it's to change what the winners are incentivized to do. Under this system, the message to Congress is “do your job or lose your job,” innovate, reach across the aisle whenever it's helpful, and come up with real solutions to our problems and create new opportunities for progress or be guaranteed new and healthy competition in the next election. Final-five voting gives voters more choice, more voice and most importantly, better results. I like to call it free-market politics because it will deliver the best of what healthy competition delivers in any industry: innovation, results and accountability. Now, before you think that I'm just making a naive overpromise of some crazy, unattainable utopia, I want to clarify that I'm not. I agree with Winston Churchill when he said, ""Democracy is the worst form of government out there, except when compared to all the others."" Democracy is messy and hard, and what we have now is messy, hard and bad results, really bad results. With final-five voting we'll have messy, hard and good results to show for it. And perhaps the most amazing part of all of this, final-five voting is powerful and achievable. We now have proof. In 2017, I published my early work on politics industry theory through Harvard Business School with my coauthor Michael Porter. The report made its way to Alaska where Scott Kendall read it, and then he took action. Scott used the work to design a ballot initiative, including these new rules. Just last month, November 2020, Alaska voters passed this initiative, and Alaska became the first state in the nation to choose healthy competition in elections for Congress. They won't be the last. It's devastating to really face how little we've come to expect from our politics. We think this is normal. We complain about it, but we've almost given up believing that it could ever be different. But this is no way to run the shining city on a hill that is America. We can choose different. Our Constitution gives us that power and, I believe, the responsibility to remake our politics when we need to -- and we need to. With the greatest urgency and without fatigue, we must aggressively reclaim the enormous promise of the great American experiment, of our American politics, our politics. Not red politics. Not blue politics, ours. Thank you."
10:11,Tim Nevius,The exploitation of US college athletes,Apr 2021,"In college sports, American universities are exploiting, disproportionately, Black athletes for billions of dollars, while diminishing their education, health and safety. Let me start with a bit of history. In November 1984, an undersized quarterback from Boston College named Doug Flutie threw a game-winning touchdown pass against the defending national champions, University of Miami. As the Hail Mary pass floated through the fall air in front of a packed stadium, millions more watched with excitement on TV. After the dramatic win, undergraduate application rates at Boston College shot up by 30 percent, revealing to universities the enormous marketing value of building high-profile sports programs. That same year, the United States Supreme Court heard a case in which the Universities of Georgia and Oklahoma challenged rules that limited the number of football games they could play on TV. Those schools saw the opportunity to not only make money by televising their games, but to also market their universities to the world. The Supreme Court agreed that the broadcasting restrictions were illegal and schools began to negotiate TV deals worth millions. That case opened the floodgates to money in college athletics, and with it, ever-growing conflicts of interest that prioritize sports over education, promote wins over health and safety and reinforce the disturbing racial and economic inequities in our country. Since then, the growth in college sports has been extraordinary and schools have earned record revenues year after year. The spending during that same time period has increased at almost the same dramatic pace, as universities engage in an arms race to the top of the rankings. Massive expenditures on new stadiums, bigger staffs and record salaries have made it appear, on the books at least, that athletic departments are losing money, while they build lavish facilities and make multimillionaires out of coaches and administrators. In fact, in 40 out of 50 states, the highest-paid public employee is now a college football or basketball coach. Meanwhile, college athletes, whose elite talents generate these massive revenues, are not only denied the ability to share in the riches they create, too many of them are not given the education they're promised, either. Today, college athletes are exploited to the tune of almost 15 billion dollars. That's how much money is generated by college sports each year. And I'm all too familiar with the exploitation, because I used to be responsible for enforcing it. Following my own college baseball career at the University of Dayton, I went on to law school before becoming an investigator at the National Collegiate Athletic Association. I traveled to college campuses across the country and helped enforce a 400-page rule book that denies athletes the right to get paid for their performance or even profit from their own name. For instance: unlike the music student who, in addition to their scholarship, can get paid to record a song, or the English student who, in addition to their scholarship, can get paid to write a book, college athletes cannot profit from their talents or even take a free meal without being ruled ineligible and risking their scholarship. During my time as an investigator, I questioned hundreds of athletes and their families about their financial transactions, dug through their personal bank and phone records and scrutinized their relationships to a humiliating degree, all for the possibility that someone gave them something beyond a scholarship, no matter how petty. In one case, I questioned Ohio State football players who received free tattoos and cash in exchange for memorabilia. The case received national attention and became known as ""Tattoo Gate,"" as if it were a scandal on par with political espionage. The players were suspended and had to repay the cash as well as the value of the tattoos. In effect, unpaid athletes were fined by a billion-dollar organization that gets paid by sponsors to decorate the athletes in corporate logos. I was told my job was to promote fairness, but there was nothing fair about that. Shortly thereafter, I left the NCAA and started fighting for the athletes. It became increasingly clear to me that rules supposedly designed to prevent exploitation instead allow a collection of universities and their wealthy corporate sponsors to profit off the athletes, who are promised an education and lured by a chance at the pros but who too often end up with nothing. Now, some people believe college athletes get a free ride. However, there is nothing free about risking health and safety while working 40 to 50 hours per week as you fight to keep your scholarship. In football alone, there are over 20,000 injuries a year, including 4,000 knee injuries and 1,000 spinal injuries. Since 2000, forty players have died. Beyond football, a recent study revealed that an estimated 60 percent of Division 1 college athletes suffer a major injury in their career, and over half of them endure chronic conditions that last well beyond their playing days. There is nothing free about that, especially as the NCAA refuses to enforce health and safety standards and has denied in court it even has that responsibility. And about that education they're promised -- according to the College Sports Research Institute, Black football and basketball players in the top five conferences graduate at 22 and 37 percent lower than the undergraduate population. Those who do graduate are often shuffled into majors with watered-down courses that conform to their athletic schedules to simply keep them eligible. The time demands and required focus on sports makes it challenging for even the most well-intentioned athlete to get a meaningful education. This is unacceptable for a 15 dollar billion industry run by institutions whose mission is to educate young people. Although plenty of athletes succeed, their achievements don't require rules that deny pay or a system that limits educational opportunities or neglects health and safety. The fact is, American universities oversee a multibillion-dollar entertainment industry that denies fundamental rights to its essential workers, a disproportionate number of whom are Black, while making millionaires of largely white coaches and administrators. This dynamic has not only deprived many young people of a meaningful education, it has shifted generations of wealth away from mostly Black families and represents the systemic inequities plaguing our society. The good news is that people are starting to see the truth. The NCAA's own public polling has revealed that a staggering 79 percent of the public believe that colleges put money ahead of their athletes. State and federal lawmakers, both Republican and Democrat, have also taken notice and started to act. Several US senators have rightly described the problems in college sports as a civil rights issue. Meanwhile, college athletes from across the country have started to stand up to demand greater health and safety protections, representation rights, attention to racial and social justice issues and economic fairness. Those who think the players should just stick to sports fail to recognize how rarely college athletes speak up and ignore the great personal risk they take in confronting a powerful industry, especially without any representation. More importantly, critics fail to acknowledge that college athletes are simply seeking rights that are afforded to virtually everyone else in this country and basic protections that shouldn't even be in question. I agree that college sports should be an enjoyable distraction, but not when they're distracting us from the very injustice they enable. In his retirement, the NCAA's first and longest-serving executive director, Walter Byers, described college sports as ""the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today's campus executives."" This is a telling quote from the man who designed this system and the one who knew it best. But you don't have to be an insider to recognize the exploitation of young people. You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to be troubled by the irresponsible spending or the disregard for values at our universities. You don't even have to be a sports fan. You just have to believe in basic ideas of fairness and the values of higher education. So let's require that all college athletes are given a chance at a meaningful education. Let's demand responsible spending by our universities and fairly allocate the billions of dollars being generated. Let's create robust health and safety standards to protect those who entertain us with their bodies and enforce those standards. Let's provide college athletes with a representative body so they have recourse when things go wrong and a voice about how to make things right. Finally, let's rise to the challenge of our time and once and for all correct the persistent racial and economic inequities that apply to college sports and beyond. Change is long overdue, but there has never been a better time than now."
10:19,Amber McReynolds,An election system that puts voters (not politicians) first,Mar 2021,"Voting can be hard. It's been hard, sometimes painful, sometimes impossible, since the very beginning of our democracy. This year and years prior, we've seen voters wait in line for five, six and seven hours. And the issue hasn't been fixed. Now, some people may see these images and think, ""How patriotic. How impressive that someone would wait in line for seven hours just to vote."" But to me, it's not impressive at all. It's disrespectful to these voters. Making voting difficult goes against the very core of our democracy. If we could redesign the system to make it more convenient, more accessible and easier for voters, why wouldn't we? Now, the short answer is: political will. Many established politicians would not actually benefit personally from a reformed voting process that's inclusive for all voters. Politicians are the players in the game, but yet they set the rules for the game. Election policy must be about who votes, not who wins. And the more complicated answer is that our voting system and election system in the United States is highly decentralized and inconsistent. Over 10,000 different local election officials administer this process in cities and towns and counties across the country. They might vary in size from 400 voters to 4.7 million. There's also 50 different state legislative bodies that set the rules of the game, and over 50 different chief election officials and entities that oversee those rules and how they're administered. So voting may vary greatly from state to state. Best-case scenario, you're in a state like Colorado, and a ballot is mailed to you proactively before each and every election. No bureaucracy, no extra paperwork. The ballot comes, and the government is responsible for delivering democracy to you. Worst-case scenario, you're in a state like Missouri, where your options are limited, you have overly restrictive voter registration deadlines. And if you can't get off work or you don't have childcare or you're sick, that's too bad. And most American voters don't fall into the best-case scenario. Now, in my career as an elections official for many years, and now leading the National Vote at Home Institute and our work to improve the voting process across the United States, I've talked to thousands of voters about their voting experience and thousands of election officials about the process. I also coauthored a book called ""When Women Vote,"" that outlines a road map and a playbook for how to improve the process for all. And so I ask you: What would you choose? Which scenario would you choose? Now, the 2016 election was the most highly watched, most anticipated election in US history. And yet, only 60 percent of eligible Americans actually voted. Over 100 million people did not vote in 2016. And when they were surveyed as to why, over 40 percent indicated it was due to a barrier: missing a deadline, couldn't get off work, couldn't wait in line for hours. If ""did not vote"" was on the ballot in 2016, ""did not vote"" would have won in a landslide. What we end up with is a system where a minority of eligible Americans are choosing the politicians that make decisions for all of us collectively. Trust in the US government and politicians is at an all-time low, and the ballot box isn't helping. If we can't even cast a vote easily, why would we ever trust the process or trust politicians? We must put voters first. I'll say that again. We must put voters first in election policies and designing a system that serves them. Just ask any successful business. We live in an era of same-day shipping, free delivery, Lyft and Uber and take-home cocktails. And consumers, especially in the height of the pandemic, are choosing their experiences in the comfort of their home and on their schedules. So why can't we design a voting process that is as convenient as that? Luckily, we don't have to speculate. In Colorado, we've already designed that process, and Colorado is now one of the best states to vote in and also one of the most secure. In 2013, I worked with a group of dedicated leaders to redesign our voting process and pass legislation that put voters first. In Colorado, every voter receives a ballot ahead of each election. They're automatically registered to vote. There's no overly restrictive deadlines. And with BallotTRACE, voters can track their ballot just like they would a package, through the process, from the moment it's mailed to the moment the election official receives it for counting. That system was pioneered in Denver now 11 years ago. And when we designed it, we were able to reduce our call volume by 70 percent and infuse transparency and accountability into the process. Now, when you get that ballot at home, you can vote it and then mail it back in or drop it off in person. And if you want to vote in person, you can do that, too. And you're not confined to the government-assigned polling places on one day. You can go to any vote center -- close to your kids' school, close to work, close to home -- and you can do so over a few weeks prior to the election. It's been seven years since we passed that legislation and implemented that model. And the results are incredible. Colorado increased turnout significantly and now is one of the top states for voter turnout and also one of the most secure. We also saw a reduction in costs. So, because more people were voting at home, we didn't need as many poll workers, and we saw that reduce by over 70 percent. When we went to buy a new voting system, we no longer needed as much equipment. We also saw voters go farther down the ballot, to local races and ballot issues. And we saw turnout increase on those down-ballot races and issues. Those races include mayor and school board and city council. And they also include the really long legalese ballot issues that take forever to figure out. Voters now have a laptop in reach at their home, and they can research candidates and issues on their own time. We also have research now that shows that voting by mail and voting at home makes voters more informed because they have all of that extra time, as opposed to being in person and worrying about the long line of voters behind you while you're trying to rush through. And the final, most important aspect of the results that we've seen out of Colorado is about civics for future voters. And I want to share my story with my two elementary children. Every time my ballot comes before each election, one of my kids gets it, and they always start asking, ""When are we going to fill out mom's ballot?"" We sit down together, they read the instructions to me, they read the candidate names, and they ask me questions like, ""Mom, what does governor do? What does the mayor do? Maybe I want to be a mayor someday."" We research those issues together, we talk about it, and it takes me forever to complete my ballot. But I know that I have created lifelong, civically engaged voters and future voters that understand that the choices they make on that ballot impact their communities and their world. This is the type of voting experience that we want for every voter across the country. Many other states have taken notice, including California, Vermont, New Jersey, Hawaii. All have expanded options for voting at home this year, in 2020. Americans are resilient. We need a voting process that is also resilient -- from a pandemic, from burdens and barriers, from inequities, from unfairness, from foreign adversaries and from administrative deficiencies. Across the country, voters are choosing to vote at home in record numbers. It is safe, it is secure, and we have built-in security measures to deter and detect bad actors who try to interfere with the process. Today, voting at home means paper ballots, but in the future, that might look very different. Voters deserve an awesome and safe voting experience, free from barriers and burdens. It's the politicians that serve us, not the other way around. You deserve excellence. Expect it, demand it and advocate for it. Thank you."
9:43,Leslie Herod,What if mental health workers responded to emergency calls?,Mar 2021,"Call me weird, but I love a good ride-along. Like, love them. I've been on ride-alongs across the world -- in Amsterdam, in Canada, in Boston, and even right here, in Denver. And what I've learned is that people call the cops for a number of reasons -- anything from a lost cat, to a neighbor they just want to know more about, to maybe a loved one or a stranger having a mental health crisis. But really, at the heart of it, people call 9-1-1 because they just don't know what else to do. What I've learned, though, is that sometimes, when you call 9-1-1, it can make a bad situation even worse. Maybe a loved one is arrested, or they're placed on a 72-hour hold; there are fines and fees, and criminal charges. And sometimes, calling 9-1-1 can be the beginning of the end of someone's life. Now, you might think I'm here to talk about abolishing the police. Not exactly. I'm actually here to talk about a different solution, a solution that takes care of a person, keeps our community safe and helps the police to focus on what they do best -- enforcing the laws. For me, it all started with a visit to Eugene, Oregon. You see, I had just passed a ballot measure here in Denver, called Caring for Denver, to provide more mental health and substance use services for people in crisis right here, in Denver, when a friend tipped me off to a program in Eugene. Normally, when you call 9-1-1, you get a firefighter, a police officer or a paramedic. But in Eugene, there's a fourth option: a mental health professional and an EMT, who ride along in a van and respond to mental health calls. The program is called CAHOOTS. Studies show that nearly 50 percent of victims of police brutality have a disability, predominantly a mental health disability. We have a huge problem with mental health in this country. The fact of the matter is police simply don't have the tools to respond to a mental health crisis. And we've seen that when we don't adequately fund mental health and substance use services, and use our jails and our prisons as de facto mental health clinics, we actually end up in much worse situations, and people's mental health is no better for it. So, I went along to Eugene to learn more. I went through a training, and then -- yay, finally -- another ride-along. I got in the van and went with the CAHOOTS team. About 20 minutes into our call, we were called to respond to a man in a mental health crisis. Immediately, I was shocked at how nice the neighborhood was. Middle-income neighborhood, kids out playing -- there was even a young boy on a tricycle in the driveway. It was just a normal day. We met up with a woman, who was the wife, and we asked her what was going on. She informed us that her husband was locked in the bathroom, and he was talking about ending his life. He had box cutters. We went inside to talk to him, and he explained to us, through a closed door, that he simply couldn't do it anymore. He was erratic. He said he wasn't going to put his family through these burdens anymore, and he just wanted it to end. We talked to him through that closed door for nearly an hour. And in the end, he just wouldn't come out. So, we left. About 30 minutes after leaving, we were called to come back on scene. You see, the police had been called. He had box cutters -- a weapon. But they knew we had been there first. So the police, they waited for us. We got there, and the police were able to convince the man to turn over his box cutters. He got dressed, and he came out of the bathroom. And then, something magical happened. You see, the police started to retreat down the stairs. The CAHOOTS team, they stepped up. They got the man to sit on the couch and talk to them. And then, they knelt down to his eye level, because he wasn't a threat, and neither were they. We sat there and we talked for about three hours. Now, I was back a little bit. And I could see, on a desk that they had in the hallway, piles and piles of papers. Unpaid medical bills. I knew what he was going through. The CAHOOTS team talked to him about his financial burdens, they talked to him about resources, and they eventually made a plan to get him to help the next day. He even ate a sandwich, and they took his vitals the entire time. When we left, he was a different person, and so was I. Sadly, the situation is all too familiar for me. You see, my sister has been in and out of the criminal justice system for about 30 years. You know, we thought she was “just an addict.” Later, we found out that she had untreated trauma from a sexual assault. We didn't know what to do, we didn't know how to help her. So when I flew back to Denver, I thought about my sister, I thought about this man, and I knew we could do better in Denver. What intrigued me so much about Eugene is that the police and the mental health crisis team, they work together -- in cahoots. An elite team of specialists trained to respond to people having a mental health or substance use crisis. See, it was the police that convinced the man to surrender the box cutters. But it was the CAHOOTS team that stepped up, connected the man to resources and listened. You see, I have been fighting for criminal justice reform my entire career. And sometimes, it can seem so daunting. There are 7,000 prisons and jails across the United States, 2.3 million inmates. For millions of Americans -- judges, attorneys, correctional officers, cops -- mass incarceration is a livelihood. To fix the criminal justice system, we must look critically at every piece of the puzzle. Find out what's working and fix what's not. If there is one thing that's clearly not working, it's the one-size-fits-all approach. Outside of Eugene, Oregon, that man would have been placed on a 72-hour hold. He could have been incarcerated, he might even have died. He would have been under more financial stress and burden, and his mental health would have been no better. Two million people are booked into jails and prisons every year. And the National Alliance for Mental Health, they've reported that 83 percent of these folks don't have access to mental health care. A well-functioning criminal justice system uses the right tool at the right time. Why are we asking our police and our prisons to fix our mental health crisis? That's not what they do. Eugene uses the standard system of triage. What's happening right now? And what does the person need, right now? But then, they have the tools to back it up. A team of trained professionals, who have the time, resources and energy to get the person to the services they need. Denver launched our co-responsemodel in 2016. We launched STAR, baby CAHOOTS, in June. Today, we have 22 co-responders, mental health professionals who ride along with law-enforcement officers. We have 11 caseworkers. In addition, we dispatch the STAR team, a paramedic and a mental health professional in a mobile crisis unit, who are trained to deal with someone in a mental health emergency. They stabilize them, they de-escalate the situation, and they connect someone with the resources that they need, ongoing care. So far, the results have been nothing short of miraculous. STAR has had a thousand calls since June. They have had to call the police for backup zero times. Additionally, the Co-Responder model has led to a less than two percent rate of tickets or citations. And the best part -- the cops love it. In fact, the thing I hear the most is ""Why don't we have STAR in my precinct yet?"" Cops are even working alongside of co-responders to deal with their own mental health traumas. They're talking through their issues with people that they actually trust. And we found this not only makes law enforcement officers safer, but it keeps the profession safer as a whole. We called the foundation Caring for Denver because caring is at the heart of it. We care about the people, we listen to their concerns, and we connect folks with the resources that they need. It's a kind approach to criminal justice, yes. But it's also a logical one. Not every problem can be solved by the police, and not everyone should go to jail. When we talk about criminal justice, what we're really talking about is people. People are at the heart of it. We deserve a better approach, one with empathy and humanity. So let's be smart about criminal justice. and use the right tool at the right time. Thank you."
4:28,Karen L. Cox,Debunking the myth of the Lost Cause: A lie embedded in American history,Feb 2021,"Between 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states withdrew from the United States and formed  the Confederate States of America. They left, or seceded, in response to the growing movement for the nationwide abolition of slavery. Mississippi said, “our position is thoroughly identified  with the institution of slavery.” South Carolina cited “hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding states to the institution of slavery.” In March 1861, the Vice President  of the Confederacy, Alexander Stevens, proclaimed that the cornerstone of the new Confederate government was white supremacy, or as he put it, “slavery” and “subordination”  to white people was the “natural and normal condition”  of Black people in America and the “immediate cause of the late  rupture and present revolution.” Three weeks after the now-infamous Cornerstone Speech, the American Civil War began. The conflict lasted four years,  had a death toll of about 750,000, and ended with the Confederacy’s defeat. By 1866,  barely a year after the war ended, southern sources began claiming the  conflict wasn’t actually about slavery. Meanwhile, Frederick Douglass, a prominent abolitionist  and formerly enslaved person, cautioned, “the spirit of secession is stronger today than ever.” From the words of Confederate leaders, the reason for the war could not have been clearer— it was slavery. So how did this revisionist history  come about? The answer lies in the Lost Cause— a cultural myth about the Confederacy. The term was coined by Edward Pollard, a pro-Confederate journalist. In 1866, he published “The Lost Cause: A New Southern History  of the War of the Confederates.” Pollard pointed out that  the U.S. Constitution gave states the right to govern themselves independently in all areas except those explicitly designated  to the national government. According to him, the Confederacy  wasn’t defending slavery, it was defending each state’s right  to choose whether or not to allow slavery. This explanation effectively turned  white southerners’ documented defense of slavery and white supremacy into a  patriotic defense of the Constitution. The Civil War had devastated the country, leaving those who had  supported the Confederacy grasping to justify their actions. Many pro-Confederate writers,  political leaders, and others were quick to adopt and spread  the narrative of the Lost Cause. One organization,  the United Daughters of the Confederacy, played a key role in transmitting  the ideas of the Lost Cause to future generations. Founded in Nashville, Tennessee,  in 1894, the UDC united thousands of middle  and upper class white southern women. The UDC raised thousands of dollars to  build monuments to Confederate soldiers. These were often unveiled  with large public ceremonies, and given prominent placements,  especially on courthouse lawns. The Daughters also placed  Confederate portraits in public schools. They monitored textbooks to minimize the horrors of slavery, and its significance in the Civil War, passing revisionist history and racist ideology down through generations. By 1918, the UDC claimed  over 100,000 members. As their numbers grew, they increased  their influence outside the South. Presidents William Howard Taft  and Woodrow Wilson both met with UDC members  and enabled them to memorialize the Confederacy  in Arlington National Cemetery. The UDC still exists and defends Confederate symbols as part of a noble heritage of sacrifice by their ancestors. Despite the wealth of primary sources showing that slavery was the root cause  of the Civil War, the myth about states’ rights  persists today. In the aftermath of the war, Frederick Douglass  and his abolitionist contemporaries feared this erasure of slavery  from the history of the Civil War could contribute  to the government’s failure to protect the rights of Black Americans— a fear that has repeatedly been proven valid. In an 1871 address at Arlington Cemetery, Douglass said: “We are sometimes asked  in the name of patriotism to forget the merits  of this fearful struggle, and to remember with equal admiration those who struck at the nation’s life, and those who struck to save it— those who fought for slavery and those who fought for liberty and justice. [...] if this war is to be forgotten,  I ask in the name of all things sacred, what shall men remember?”"
10:35,Nora Flanagan,What COVID-19 revealed about US schools — and 4 ways to rethink education,Jan 2021,"The last day of school was barely school. I fielded complicated questions from students who braved public transit to attend, I wiped down every desk between classes and reminded myself to breathe. I held it together so hard when students said goodbye, with a strange, scared weight on that word. Colleagues and I exchanged glances in the hallway, at once tense and comforting. We were in this together, even if we were about to part ways for several months. And when school as we know it stopped, we all took a long minute just to process that. It seemed impossible. 400,000 students in Chicago now needed to learn from home, and we would need to make that happen, both as the third-largest school district in the country and as the human beings who constitute it. But the seemingly impossible keeps becoming reality really fast lately. So teachers jumped and adapted. We learned to host online meetings, we hung whiteboards on our living room walls. Many teachers struggled just reaching out to see if their students were alright. And in addition to making remote learning plausible, teachers have also been organizing food drives and housing resources. They have made and donated masks by the thousands, and they've never stopped reaching out. But this isn't new. This isn't dramatic heroism in the face of a pandemic. This is teaching. This is being invested in our communities. As parents, we've had to adapt too, because our working lives and our family lives and our mental health have all collided and coagulated. Well-intentioned color-coded schedules speckled the internet. Everyone has cried at the kitchen table, at least once. Some of us several times. And then, there are the students. I've seen students participate in class from the breakroom at work, where they are frontline for minimum wage to help their families. They've attended a makeshift funeral in the morning and a Google Meet in the afternoon. They are childcare providers, they are experiencing housing insecurity, they are scared, they are stressed, and they are children. When my son's teacher asked a screen full of nine-year-olds if everybody was OK, it almost broke me. ""How are you?"" ""What do you need?"" ""Is your family safe?"" School without school has been traumatic, it's been makeshift, it's been messy. Parents, teachers and students have fumbled with tech, fumbled even more with expectations. And we've lost so much. And maybe, just maybe, stripped bare like it's been, we can see more. When words like ""rigor,"" ""grit"" and a half dozen other educational hashtags don't seem to matter, we can see what's in front of us with new clarity. And that includes the gaps, the inequities, the failures. They're all heightened. But so are the successes. So what's working? What do kids need from their schools? And what do we really mean when we discuss, frame and fund education? As both a parent and a teacher, I keep coming back to four big ideas. None of them are new, all of them are necessary. And in them, I'm hoping other parents, other teachers and students will hear echoes of their experiences and outlines of what's possible. We can, and we must, engage parents, demand equity, support the whole student and rethink assessment. First and foremost, engaging the parents. Historically, we've isolated parents and teachers, schools and neighborhoods. We say otherwise, but the influential forces in a kid's life rarely intersect with any depth. We have parent-teacher conferences, a STEM night, a bake sale we all immediately regret agreeing to do. But the parents are here now, every day, inadvertently eavesdropping on class, because we're also making lunch or sharing a workspace. We are tutors, we are coteachers, we are all relearning algebra, and it's awkward. But maybe it's exactly what we needed, because parents are seeing how school happens, or doesn't, what excites their kids and what shuts them down, whether there's a rubric for it or not. And we’re watching our kids learn empathy and balance and time management and tree-climbing and introspection and the value of a little bit of boredom. We might not want this to last, but we can learn from it. We can keep parents engaged, beyond bake sales. We can take this time and ask parents what they and their kids need. Ask again. Ask in every language. Ask the parents who haven't been able to engage with their kids' remote learning. Meet parents where they are, and many will tell you they need us to prioritize their children's wellness, support diverse learners, protect neighborhoods from housing instability and attacks on immigrant communities. So many parents will tell us right now that they can't support their children's learning if they can't support their families. So next, we demand equity. Our school system currently serves a student population that includes 75 percent low-income households and 90 percent students of color. The fight for equity in Chicago is as old as Chicago. So what do we need right now? For starters, we need equal tech infrastructure for all. This isn't an option anymore. We have to close the tech gap. These are choices, and we don't have to keep making them. We can refuse the isolation and competition for resources that pits schools and neighborhoods against one another, get rid of rating systems and budgeting formulas that punish kids for their zip codes in a city that's been segregated since its inception. The fight for equity in Chicago did not become life or death in the pandemic -- it's been life or death for a long time now. We need to care about other people's children, and not just as data points alongside our own. Third, we need to support the whole student. As much as parents might be exhausted by remote learning and can't wait to get the kids back to school, or teachers can't wait to get back into our classrooms and do some real teaching, chances are the kids miss the playground more than the classroom, the activities as much as the academics, that social emotional peace that forms the core of human learning. We will need social workers, nurses and counselors in every school, so much. We will need them as we try to help our students feel safe, process their trauma and their grief and find their way back to school. To support our students, we will also need smaller class sizes and adequate staffing across the building, something teachers have demanded again and again, with the overwhelming support of our students' parents. We will need art class, more than ever. And physical education and music programs and computer science. And if wading through conspiracy theories on the internet for the last few months has taught us anything, it's that we need to put a librarian back in every school, right now. Finally, let's rethink assessment. We can dial down the testing a lot. Elementary school students in Chicago spend up to 10 percent of their school year just taking standardized tests. We don't know how many hours of learning are lost preparing for those tests, but we know the test-prep software alone costs Chicago about 10 million dollars a year. How much more could we do if we got that time and money back? And do we have to go back to obsessively quantifying everything a student attempts, weaponizing grades as a means of compliance and reinforcing inequity at every grade level? Or can we keep considering alternative models, like proficiency-based grading programs, and stop making school about scoring better than the kid next to you? 150 colleges and counting are now test-optional for admissions, including NYU, the University of Chicago and the entire California State system, because they know there's more to a student than a GPA and an SAT score. You know who else knows that? The students themselves. If we are having conversations about any of this, and not authentically including and empowering students every step of the way, we're not having conversations about any of this. We have a moment now -- a short moment, and so much to get done before the comforting choruses of ""back to normal"" get too loud, when we can take what we've seen and experienced, plant our feet and demand better. We can make a system as massive as Chicago pivot to better serve our students, their families and our communities. If 3,000,000 teachers can relearn their jobs in a weekend, we can change school systems to better fit what we know, and what we've known for a while now. And if we can set clear expectations for our students, we can do the same for our school districts and our cities. I want to go back to school. I can't wait to go back to school. I miss the hum of the hallways and the weird energy of a room filling up with sophomores, and a better kind of exhaustion from putting my heart and my guts into what I love doing every day. But we can't miss this moment. We can't let go of the mantra that we are in this together. So don't tell us what is or isn't possible, don’t tell us it’s too hard or too expensive or too aggressive. It's been our job since the start of this pandemic -- no, it's been our job since always to make what seems impossible really happen. And when the stakes are this high, and the evidence is this clear, it's our only option."
5:48,Amanda Gorman,"""The Hill We Climb""",Jan 2021,
4:47,Yen Pham,"Why should you read Toni Morrison's ""Beloved""?",Jan 2021,"A mirror that shatters without warning. A trail of cracker crumbs  strewn across the floor. Two tiny handprints that appear on a cake. Everyone at 124 Bluestone Road knows their house is haunted— but there’s no mystery about  the spirit tormenting them. This ghost is the product  of an unspeakable trauma; the legacy of a barbaric history that hangs over much more  than this lone homestead. So begins ""Beloved,"" Toni Morrison’s  Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the suffering wrought by slavery and the wounds that persist in its wake. Published in 1987, ""Beloved""  tells the story of Sethe, a woman who escaped enslavement. When the novel opens, Sethe  has been living free for over a decade. Her family has largely dissolved— Sethe’s mother-in-law died years earlier, and her two sons ran away  from fear of the specter. Sethe’s daughter Denver remains  in the house, but the pair live a half-life. Shunned by the wider community, the two have only each other  and the ghost for company. Sethe is consumed by thoughts of the spirit, whom she believes to be  her eldest daughter. When a visitor from Sethe’s old life returns and threatens the ghost away, it seems like the start of a new beginning for her family. But what comes in the ghost’s place may be even harder to bear. As with much of Morrison’s work, ""Beloved"" investigates the roles of trauma and love in African-American history. Morrison writes about black identities in a variety of contexts, but her characters are united  by their desire to find love and be loved— even when it’s painful. Some of her novels explore when love challenges social conventions, like the forbidden affection that grows between the townsfolk of ""Paradise"" and their fugitive neighbors. Other works examine how we can be blind to the love we already possess. In ""Sula,"" one character realizes  that it’s not her marriage, but rather, one of her friendships  that embodies the great love of her life. Perhaps Morrison’s most famous exploration of the difficulty of love takes place in ""Beloved."" Here, the author considers how  the human spirit is diminished when you know the things and people you love most will be taken away. Morrison shows that slavery  is destructive to love in all forms, poisoning both enslaved people and their enslavers. ""Beloved"" examines the dehumanizing effects of the slave trade in numerous ways. Some are straightforward,  such as referring to enslaved people as animals with monetary value. But others are more subtle. Sethe and Paul D.— the visitor from her old plantation— are described as trying  to “live an unlivable life.” Their coping mechanisms are different; Sethe remains mired in her past, while Paul D. dissociates himself completely. But in both cases, it’s clear each character has been irreparably scarred. Morrison also blends  perspectives and timelines, to convey how the trauma of slavery ripples across various characters and time periods. As she delves into the psyche  of townspeople, enslavers, and previously enslaved people, she exposes conflicting viewpoints on reality. This tension shows the limitations of our own perspectives, and the ways in which some characters are actively avoiding the reality of their actions. But in other instances, the characters’ shifting memories align perfectly; capturing the collective trauma that haunts the story. Though ""Beloved"" touches on dark subjects, the book is also filled  with beautiful prose, highlighting its characters’ capacity for love and vulnerability. In a stream-of-consciousness sequence written from Sethe’s perspective, Morrison unspools memories of subjugation alongside moments of tenderness; like a baby reaching for her mother’s earrings, spring colors, and freshly painted stairs. Sethe’s mother-in-law had them painted white, she recalls, “so you could see your way to the top…  where lamplight didn’t reach."" Throughout the book, Morrison asks us to consider hope in the dark, and to question what freedom really means. She urges readers to ponder the power we have over each other, and to use that power wisely. In this way, ""Beloved"" remains a testimony to the destructiveness of hate, the redeeming power of love, and the responsibility we bear to heed the voices of the past."
10:28,María Teresa Kumar,How the new generation of Latinx voters could change US elections,Nov 2020,"María Teresa Kumar: Much has been made of the 2020 US election. Right now, just over a week later, pollsters are issuing mea culpas, Democrats are tentatively celebrating, Republicans are blowing their collective tops, lawyers are busier than ever, ballot-counters are still hard at it, and demographers are desperately trying to understand who voted, for whom, where and why. Much has been said of the Latino vote in this election, which is something I know a little bit about, having been working obsessively over it for the last 16 years. Latinos are the fastest-growing demographic, with the largest voter registration cap in America. A Latino youth turns 18 every 30 seconds. While the mode for whites in America is 58, the mode for Latinx is 11 years old. You heard that right. And it's these new voters and the youth who are translating America for their immigrant families who are leading the charge for audacious change. An estimated 73 percent of Latinx youth voted for Biden. As members of the largest generation globally, these Latino youth mirror their peers, seeking intervention for climate equity, racial justice and gender parity. What we're hearing right now in America and around the globe is a demand for a massive reset on how we will govern in the 21st century for a world that is livable, equitable and just. Too many young people are drowning in student debt here in America, their families have been ravaged by the pandemic, who have lost jobs, lives and housing, and still, in 2020, they showed up for an America to believe in. Many say that 1914, the eve of World War I, defined the 20th century in America. That meant FDR's New Deal that doubled down on its citizens by nation-building, offering pathways to the middle class through public works, education and sponsoring artists and musicians, building roads to provide jobs and sponsoring science-driven blueprints that allowed a man almost 40 years later to look up at the Moon and say that he wanted to go there. And we did that with less technology than the smartphone feeding this talk. So my hope is that the 21st century will be remembered as starting February 2020, not because that was when COVID ravaged us and in doing so, exposed the real, deep socioeconomic and racial disparities that ail us, but because that was when Americans cast a ballot for the future that believes in addressing the climate crisis, that health care is a right, that racial inequities hinder us all. We have a window to meet the precedent set by the Greatest Generation and define our century as one that is equitable and sustained. I, for one, am excited to get to work. I hope you'll join me to usher in this audacious change together. Bianca DeJesus: María Teresa, thank you so much for that. MTK: Thank you, Bianca. Thank you for this conversation. BD: It is an honor. So, some commentators seem to be confounded that in certain places, Republicans received meaningful numbers of Latinx votes. Of course, it's kind of silly to imagine that any demographic is a monolith, and within our community, there are so many differences. So what is the most productive way to think about heterogeneity within the Latinx, and really, within any community? MTK: If we don't have public elected officials talking to our community, especially a new community, that is coming of age, that is relatively new to the democratic process, someone else will fill that vacuum. But I can share with you one of the things that we knew at Voto Latino was that young Latinos are navigating America for their families. Those youth turned up to protect their families, and it was not just in Arizona, but we also saw it Nevada, we also saw it in Pennsylvania, we saw it in Georgia and in North Carolina. And if you want to have an inclusive America, you have to fight for the vote, and that is basically what we need to see right now. But when we talk to young people, they voted disproportionately because they wanted climate change, they wanted access to health care, and they wanted to talk about the real racial inequities. When George Floyd sadly was murdered tragically, Latinos were side by side with the African American community because we recognize that that is something that truly plagues our American existence and that we have to address it if we want to move forward. BD: Absolutely. So do you see evidence that patterns change regarding first- and second- generation Latinx voters, and how does assimilation play out in terms of long-term voting trends? MTK: That's interesting. So at Voto Latino, we don't believe that there's an assimilation. Right? What we want is an enhancement of American culture. Just like we celebrate St. Patrick's Day, we want to be able to celebrate our roots and recognize the importance of that richness. We are in a very unique moment in America, where we have the most diverse population in the world, and one can argue that that is why some people don't want us to succeed, because it's our human capital, our vision, our ability to move forward and our diversity that prepares us for this century. And so when we talk about the differences in the Latino community, it's also the differences in America that makes us so much richer with our imagination, with our ability to have entrepreneurship, and we have to use that and harness it for good. Some people will say race is what is our Achilles' heel. I actually believe that it's the diversity of our races and our cultures that actually prepares us to battle the 21st century that it's already interglobal. And the more that we harness that beauty of that diversity, that is what prepares us to compete and define the 21st century. BD: Wow. Yeah. I think that's beautiful and totally agree. So how can we make first-time voters repeat voters who are engaged in future elections and not just for presidential elections but for local government as well? MTK: One of the things that we are seeing is that we're seeing more young people run for office, and the more people start running for office, they realize that local government is what makes the most impact, at least here in America. So if you want, for example, some racial reform in your judicial system, vote for your district attorney, vote for your city councilman. If you think that there's disparities in our education system, run for your school board. So that's one. But the other thing to send very clearly to politicians is that when young -- Americans voted their heart out. Young Latinos, youth in general, outvoted the people before them, but they're voting on making a bet that their life will change, because the last four years could not have been rockier. And if the folks that are elected don't meet the challenges of addressing climate change, addressing racial equity and gender parity and health care for all, they run the risk of not having those people vote again in 2024, and we need everybody on deck. And so our job as citizens is to ensure that we give the people that we just voted into office the courage to do the right thing, and that means to continue the rallies, continue calling our members of Congress, writing those letters and running for office ourselves. BD: So one question that speaks to the theme of this year's TED Women, ""Fearless,"" I think it's accurate to say that there's been a lot of fear within the Latinx community over the last few years. How does that begin to change now? MTK: I will share with you, the day after Donald Trump was elected, all of our worst nightmares came to fruition. We saw family separation, one of the cruelest forms of our nation's history came back to haunt us, because we've done it before, and everyone lived in fear. And the day after Joe Biden's declaration on Saturday, I can tell that there was a collective -- we've been holding our breath for so long, there was a collective release of not only that are we going to be OK but that fellow Americans stood up as allies and said, ""Not one more."" And so that is what gives me hope, is that this was a collective America who outvoted their hearts out, because we see that in our celebration of our country's future is believing in democracy, believing in a transition of power, believing that the most votes won and the electoral college was on our side, and more importantly, that these issues that Trump tried to ascend his presidency for the second time that were based on racism, that were based on the callousness of treating people and women differently, that they were not going to withstand. And so we do have to rebuild, but we have to rebuild not because of the four years of Donald Trump. If anything, I think he just exposed a lot of our fractures. We have to rebuild based on the last, I would say, 20 years. But the great thing is that the voters are here for it, and young people are here for it. I don't have to change a young person's mind that we are in a climate crisis. They get it. Cultural change is the hardest to do, but we have generations there with us, because they're there and they get it. BD: (Exhales) That's a relief. So, you yourself have been fearlessly outspoken. What drives you forward personally? MTK: I deeply -- I don't know if I've been fearless -- I deeply believe in our country, and I deeply believe in us, and I deeply believe that when we are present, there's nothing we can't do. And when I say that, we ... As a generation, we will not have an opportunity to reimagine what our country looks like, our systems of governments look like, and there will be people -- you know, my children are six and eight, who will ask me 15 years from now, ""What did you do?"" And I want to say that I was alongside allies and the American people to rebuild better and to reimagine better. And we have always been a country of entrepreneurship, design and imagination, and what a perfect place to start when the majority of Americans are with us. BD: Absolutely. Well, thank you so, so much, María Teresa. MTK: Thank you."
4:06,Elizabeth Cox,Can you outsmart the fallacy that started a witch hunt?,Oct 2020,"Ah, a witch hunt. Humans are tireless in their pursuit of reason. ""It’s 1950. Following threats from the communist  governments of the Soviet Union and China, anti-communist sentiment in  the United States is at an all-time high. Senator Joseph McCarthy claims  he has a list of 205 communists in the US who are influencing government policy."" Didn’t I just change the channel? Ah, I see. It’s a different witch hunt. ""The senate forms a committee  to investigate McCarthy’s claims. McCarthy names his first case: against prominent lawyer, judge, and activist Dorothy Kenyon. He accuses her of membership to 28  organizations that are communist fronts. Newspapers around the country  rush to her defense, pointing out her vocally  anti-communist record. The senate committee schedules  a hearing anyway, and she has just five days to prepare."" This is too much. If the government won’t be  a voice of reason, I’ll have to. That’s better. I’m surprised you good legislators have agreed to move this hearing forward. You’re falling prey to a type  of argument from ignorance: assuming that a claim is true  because it hasn’t been proven false. The claim being Senator McCarthy’s  accusations against Judge Kenyon, for which he provided  no legitimate evidence. Is that right? I thought so. Some of the so-called communist  organizations he accused her of joining don’t even exist. To assume a claim is true  because it hasn’t been proven false ignores many other possibilities: that it hasn’t been proven false yet,  that it can’t be proven true or false, or that it isn’t completely true  or completely false, to name a few. This leads to a handy rule of thumb: the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. In other words, you make the claim, you supply the proof. If someone told you aliens exist, would you head off to find proof that they don’t exist? Of course not. You’d tell that person  to show you the UFO. The same applies when someone  makes a claim that contradicts an established consensus. So when all the available evidence  suggests that humans are causing an increase  in global temperatures, the burden of proof has been fulfilled— if you disagree, it becomes  your responsibility to prove otherwise. Right? Ah, I’ve gotten ahead of myself. You’ll see what I mean soon enough. Anyway, your legal system  supposedly recognizes this rule— so what are you all doing here? ""It’s July 17th, 1950, and the senate subcommittee has officially dismissed all charges against Kenyon."" As they should! ""It’s 1954, and the senate  has formally disciplined McCarthy."" Took them long enough! ""He will serve out the rest of his term, but will never again be elected  to a public office. Because of his widespread  anti-communist influence, hundreds of people have been incarcerated, and thousands have lost their jobs."" Ah! Look what the communists did!"
16:25,Van Jones,What if a US presidential candidate refuses to concede after an election?,Oct 2020,"OK, as an attorney, as a political commentator, and frankly, as a former White House official, I used to think I knew a lot about how America picks a president. I was wrong, I did not know. And this year, I've been doing some research into some of the fine print and all the different things in our constitution that we never talk about, and I've discovered some legal loopholes that shocked me, I guarantee will shock you, and could determine the way that the presidential election of 2020 turns out. For instance, did you know that under our constitution a presidential candidate could actually lose the popular vote, fail to get a majority in the electoral college, refuse to concede, manipulate hidden mechanisms in our government and still get sworn in as the president of the United States of America? That's a true fact. I know it sounds like some crazy ""House of Cards"" episode, and I wish it was, because then we could just change the channel, but I just described to you a real-world, real-life possibility that could occur this year, the year I'm talking, in 2020, or in some other year, if we don't fix some of these glitches in our system. So if you think, though, that the American people's choice in a US presidential election should actually be sworn in to become president of the United States, please pay attention to this talk. I'm going to teach you how to stop a coup, OK? Now, where to begin? Alright, how about this: It turns out that one of the main safeguards of US democracy is not in the constitution at all. It's not in the law at all. It's actually just a little tradition, it's a little custom. And yet, this one voluntary gesture is one of the main reasons that you almost never have riots and bloodshed and strife after a US election. What I'm talking about is a concession speech. OK, it's ironic, it's the one speech no presidential candidate ever wants to give, and yet, it is that public address that is most important for the health and the well-being of our nation. It's that speech, you know, when a presidential contender gives, it's after the advisers come and the media tells them, ""Look, you're not going to get enough votes to be able to hit that magic number of 270 electoral college votes. You're just not going to get there."" At that moment -- you don't think about this, but the fate of the entire republic is in the hands of a single politician and their willingness to walk out there and stand in front of their family and stand in front of the cameras and stand in front of the whole nation and say, ""I am conceding the race, voluntarily. Thank you to my supporters. The other person has won now, congratulations to them, let's unite behind them, let's move on, let's be one country. God bless America."" You've seen it a thousand times. Make no mistake, this is a remarkable tradition in our country. Because at that moment, that candidate still has at her command a nationwide army of campaign activists, of die-hard partisans, tens of thousands of people. They could just as easily take up arms, take to the streets, they could do whatever they want to. But that concession speech instantly demobilizes all of them. It says, ""Hey, guys, stand down. Folks, it's over."" Moreover, that concession speech helps the tens of millions of people who voted for that person to accept the outcome. Acknowledge the winner, however begrudgingly, and then just get up the next morning, go to work, go to school, maybe disappointed but not disloyal to America's government. And even more importantly, that concession speech has a technical function in that it kind of allows all the other stuff that our constitution requires after the voting, and there are a bunch of steps like, you've got the electoral college that has got to meet, you've got Congress who's got to ratify this thing, you've got an inauguration to be had, all that stuff can just move ahead on automatic pilot because after the concession speech, every subsequent step to either reinstate the president or elevate a new president just happens on a rubber-stamp basis. The constitution requires it, but it's a rubber stamp. But we sometimes forget, candidates do not have to concede. There's nothing that makes them concede. It's just a norm in a year in which nothing is normal. So what if a losing candidate simply refuses to concede? What if there is no concession speech? Well, what could happen might terrify you. I think it should. First, to give you  the background, let's make sure we're on the same page, let me give you this analogy. Think about a presidential election as a baseball game. The end of the ninth inning, whoever is ahead wins, whoever is behind loses. That's baseball. But could you imagine  a different world in which, in baseball, there were actually 13 innings, or 14 innings, not just nine. But we just had a weird tradition. If you are behind in the ninth inning, you just come out and concede. Alright? So all those other innings don't matter. That's really how the presidential elections work in America. Because the constitution actually spells out two different sets of innings. You've got the popular election process that everybody pays attention to. And then you've got the elite selection process that everybody essentially ignores. But in a close election, if nobody concedes, the second invisible process, these extra innings if you will, they actually matter a whole lot. Let me explain. That first set of innings, popular election, it's what you think about when you think about the presidential election. It's the primaries, the caucuses, the debates, the conventions, it's election night, it's all that stuff. Most of the time, the loser on election night at that point just concedes. Why? ""The American people have spoken."" All that. But according to the constitution, the game is technically not over. After the cameras go away, after the confetti's swept away, the constitution requires this whole other set of innings. This elite selection process stuff, and this is all behind closed doors, it's among government officials. And this process goes from the end of the vote counting in November, through December all the way and then January. You just never think about it, because for so many generations, these extra innings haven't mattered much because the election-night loser just concedes. So this other stuff is just a formality. Even in 2000, vice president Al Gore gave up as soon as the Supreme Court ordered an end to the vote counting. Gore did not continue the fight into the state legislatures, into the electoral college, into Congress, he didn't try to discredit the results in the press. Frankly, he didn't send his supporters out into the streets with protest signs or pitchforks or long guns. As soon as the court said the vote count is done, he just conceded to George W. Bush. Because that's what we do, that's just kind of how we do things around here. You don't fight in the extra innings. Until maybe 2020, when one major candidate is already saying he may not accept the results of the vote counting. Curse you 2020. So what can happen instead? Instead of conceding, a losing candidate could launch a ferocious fight to grab power anyway. Or to hold onto power anyway. In the courts, yes. But also in the state houses, electoral college, even in Congress. They could file, for instance, dozens of lawsuits attempting to block the counting of millions of, like, mail-in ballots, saying they should all be thrown out, they're all fraudulent. Then, they could demand that the states refuse to certify the election because of all this alleged fraud, or interference from a foreign power. Or the loser's party could send a rival slate of electors to the electoral college or to Congress, and say, ""We're the real electors,"" and create a whole situation with that. Any of this stuff could create such a mess in the electoral college and the Congress, that the whole matter just winds up in front of the House of Representatives for the first time since the 1800s. Now, here's where it gets totally crazy. If the presidential election winds up in the House of Representatives, they don't have to pay any attention at all to the popular vote or the electoral vote. It's like the election never happened. And then it gets even crazier. The final tally in the House is taken not by delegates but by delegation. In other words, individual congresspeople don't get to vote. It's done by states. Now, get your head wrapped around this. In 2020, the majority of Americans live in blue states, but there are more red states. So there's a possibility that the Republicans in the House of Representatives could just anoint their candidate to be president, even without the popular vote, or a majority in electoral college. That could happen. Now some people would call that outcome a perfectly legal, perfectly constitutional coup against the very idea of majority rule in the United States. That is possible under our constitution, and it can happen this year. So what can you do about it? OK now, keep in mind, if the margin of the victory is so massive, it's truly massive, the losing candidate's political party is going to walk away and just let their leader go down. Nobody is going to risk a constitutional crisis to save somebody who is super unpopular. But if the race is close, all bets are off. And then the fight could continue long past election night. You could be, you know, trying to deal impact this whole other process you never heard of before. You're going to have to be lobbying, protesting, speaking out, contacting lawmakers, a whole other process you've never done before. So landing in this completely unfamiliar scenario, what can you do? How are we supposed to act? What are we supposed to do in this situation? There's basically three things that matter. Number one, get informed. A number of progressive organizations are already working hard to warn Americans about this growing threat to our democracy. Some organizations you could look into and research for yourself: choosedemocracy.us, electiontaskforce.org, protectdemocracy.org, mobilize.us, allamericans.org, civicalliance.com and the Fight Back table at demos.org. All these groups are working on this. Now, on the right, if that's your cup of tea, you could also check out The Heritage Foundation or the Government Accountability Institute. They are focused on voter fraud. But you've got to get informed, no matter what side you're on. Also, number two, you've got to get loud. You've got to get loud. Situation like this, these days, everybody is a media channel. You are the media. So use your own voice. And when you do, my advice: speak to universal American values, not the partisan stuff, OK? Speak to the American values that every American should be down with, no matter what party they're in. The idea that every voter counts and that every vote should be counted, that's an American value, period. The notion that the majority should rule in America, that's an American value. The idea that an incumbent president should concede honorably and graciously and ensure a peaceful transfer of power, rather than trying to use every trick in the book to hang on to power, that's an American value too. If you stick with those values, you're going to be heard by a lot more people and help bring the country together. And lastly, sorry folks, voting is not enough, You're going to have to get active, get involved. You could join and support with your money. Some existing organizations, powerful groups, like the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the ACLU, NAACP, Legal Defense Fund, Indivisible, ColorOfChange.org, these groups are going to be fighting in the courts, fighting in Congress, to try to make sure that we have a fair outcome. Those groups could use your help and your donations. But if it gets to the point where you feel that you have to take it to the streets, that you're going to have to go outside and demonstrate and march and protest, please do it peacefully. This is not just philosophy or morality. A lot of studies have shown that it's the peaceful protests that are more successful at challenging these would-be dictators and reversing coup attempts. It's the peaceful ones, why? Because when the protests turn violent, all that chaos and carnage actually chases away supporters. So rather than demonstrations getting bigger, and the protests getting bigger, they start to shrink. Then the government looks reasonable when it cracks down. So it's actually a lot better to follow the guidance of the late great Gene Sharp. Now he has written beautifully and well about how strategically you can roll back a coup just using very smart, very disciplined, very nonviolent protest. And a lot of his best ideas, and people have been influenced by that, are available in a new guidebook called, ""Hold the Line."" You can look it up, it's called ""Hold the Line, The Guide to Defending Democracy."" You can get that at holdthelineguide.com. And that can give you a real good framework to move forward in a smart, peaceful way if you feel that you've got to take it to the streets. Now look, I know all this stuff is overwhelming, and I've got to admit, some of these steps may not be enough. A truly rogue president could call on private armed militia to try to intimidate lawmakers into keeping him or her in power. Or they could just abuse their emergency powers and try to stay in office indefinitely. So we've got some real problems in our system. The best way to stop a coup is to update and strengthen our democratic system as soon as this election is over. Maybe we need to rethink, reimagine or just get rid of this whole electoral college, extra inning thing in the first place. I know for sure we've got to do a better job of protecting voter rights, of prosecuting voter intimidation and also making sure we've got the technology that nobody needs to be afraid of voter fraud. These are the steps that we're going to have to take to make sure that we have a democracy and the democracy endures. Because never forget this: in the long sweep of human history, a democratic republic is the rarest form of government on earth. Democracies are fragile. Democracies can fail. And what citizens do or fail to do in a moment of crisis can determine the final fate of government of, by and for the people. So let's do our best, vote, but this time, we've got to stay vigilant and active, even after the ballots have been counted. We've got to stay active all the way through to inauguration day. But I want to say to you, I will support the winner of a free and fair election no matter which candidate wins, and I will oppose any so-called winner who prevails by twisting the process beyond recognition. Because any American should be willing to concede an election, but no American should concede the core principles of democracy itself. Thank you."
11:57,Kedra Newsom Reeves,How to reduce the wealth gap between Black and white Americans,Oct 2020,"As last recorded by the US Federal Government, the median wealth for a white family in the United States was 171,000 dollars and the median wealth for a Black family was just 17,000 dollars, a 10x different over 150 years after the end of slavery. I think first we have to ask ourselves, what is wealth really? Well, wealth is all of your assets, all of the things that you own, minus all of your liabilities. Assets are things like your car, your house, your savings account, your checking account, your investments, if you own other properties, your business. Well, that gap, that 10x gap, is partially because for many years, decades in fact, Black Americans were left off of that ladder and didn't really have access to it. Well, why are we talking about this now? Well, in 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic and a looming recession, inequities are really laid bare across nearly every system in the United States: health care, education, criminal justice and finance, and people were moved to take action online, in streets, in meetings at work, in corporate boardrooms. And I, as a consultant, started having conversations with clients that I thought I would never have. I guess the question that I'd been asking myself is, how do we make sure that in this moment, this results in action and progress that starts to close that wealth gap for Black versus white Americans? So who am I? My name is Kedra Newsom Reeves. I am a consultant for banking institutions, hedge funds, asset managers. But before any of that, I am a Black American who is the descendant of slaves. And when we talk about the wealth gap, it's really important to understand the history, so I thought I'd tell a little story about a family, my family, and how policy intersects with wealth. So we'll start with my great-great-grandfather. He was a man named Silas Newsom, and Silas was born a slave outside Nashville, Tennessee, on Newsom Station, where he and his family worked on a quarry. He didn't own anything. He didn't own his home. He didn't own property. He didn't really even own his own body, his own labor, his children. Any of those things, all of those things, were here to create wealth for someone else. So we believe that he was a servant during the Civil War for a Confederate general who was actually fighting to keep him enslaved, so he really had no wealth, he had no control over his life. Well, at the end of slavery, there was a policy opportunity. There was a question: what do we do for the hundreds of years of slavery now that we are ending slavery and the country is coming together? And there was a choice. We could make a settlement with the slaves, or we could make a settlement with the slave owners. Well, the slaves had no power to advocate for themselves in that moment, and the country had to be united, so the federal government decided to give that settlement to slave owners, essentially giving them money for the property that they had lost at the end of the war. And not their physical property, not their homes, but people, the slaves that had provided free labor for years and decades. So Silas, at the end of the Civil War, had no wealth. He was free but had no wealth. He became a sharecropper. My great-grandfather Silas was born a number of years after the end of slavery, and he was drafted to serve in World War I along with 350,000 other Black American soldiers in segregated units. He served in the war. When he came back to the United States, at the end of the war, there was very anti-Black sentiment. The economy was compressing, there were a lot of stressors, and Black people could not get land, they could not get loans for homes, they really could not acquire any credit to build wealth over time, so he also became a farmer. And he had a son, also named Silas -- there are a lot of Silases in my family -- my grandfather. My grandfather Silas was also a soldier and fought in World War II. After World War II, the US Federal Government passed the GI Bill, which provided support for veterans. And the bill provided for building of hospitals, student loans and, most importantly for wealth-building, low-interest home mortgages for veterans. In the years following the war, the GI Bill accounted for four billion dollars of funding to nine million veterans. But Black veterans largely did not benefit. So Silas, my grandfather, came back to Nashville, Tennessee, and he married my grandmother, whose name is Cinderella. Yes, my grandmother's name was Cinderella. And they had eight children. But they never bought a home. And the highlight of their housing journey was moving into a new public housing project with their children and paying rent for that housing project, which in terms of the quality of housing was fantastic for them and a step up, but did not allow them to build wealth. My father, another soldier, a 20-year veteran of the United States Marines, bought his first home in his early 50s, but it took four generations for our family to move into homeownership and begin to build ownership and equity in a home. That's one family's story, and I skipped a lot of things that happened between the end of slavery and today: redlining, housing discrimination before the Fair Housing Act in the 1970s, the really important role that Black-owned banks played in building Black communities, the Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s, which crushed a lot of Black banks, and the subprime crisis in 2008, which stripped a lot of Black and brown homeowners of their homes. There's a lot of history there, but that story tells you a bit about how we get to this 10x gap where we are today. Now, certainly, as we think about the size of that gap, it is critical for the Federal Government to take a number of actions. That said, financial institutions play a really important role in providing access to credit, access to capital, to build communities and allow Black communities to thrive. We have to be clear; managing 17,000 dollars better does not get us there. Better education does not get us there. Access to credit and capital are critical. So I want to talk about four solutions today that financial institutions can contribute to start to close the wealth gap. Number one is getting more people on the ladder, getting more people banked. We know today that about half of Black Americans are un- or underbanked. Unbanked means that you don't have a banking account. Underbanked means that you have a bank account but you use alternative services for check-cashing or payday lending or paying bills. And that's not just expensive from a transaction perspective in terms of the fees that you pay, it's also expensive in terms of the time that you commit to paying a bill. Think about how you pay your utility bill today. It probably comes out of your checking account. You don't even think about it. You set it up in advance, and it's automatic. Well, if you're unbanked, you are probably going to get a money order somewhere, physically, a piece of paper. You then travel to City Hall or your DMV to pay that bill. About 40 percent of people who are unbanked say they are unbanked because they think they don't have the minimum amount to really maintain a checking account. Well, that's just not true. In the last several years, credit unions, community banks and major banking institutions have created low-cost, no-minimum checking and savings account products specifically made for this population. So we have an issue with awareness. Banks, community partners and others have to work together to increase the awareness of these products in communities that need them, so that we can start to reduce the number of people who are un- and underbanked and get them on the ladder that we talked about earlier. The challenge is about 28 percent of Black and Latinx families are credit-invisible, which means that you have a thin credit file or no credit file. And the way that credit works and creditworthiness assessments work is to say, if you can prove that you have paid credit back consistently previously, then I can lend you more credit. It's kind of a chicken or an egg situation. The interesting thing is that banks and financial technology companies have really innovated in recent years to use alternative data -- cable bills, utility bills, rent payments, etc. -- to show that you're able to consistently make payments. The additional challenge on this one, unlike the last one, which was more about awareness, is that you need to have regulatory support to do these things. You need to prove to regulators that you are able to fairly use alternative data to lend credit to marginalized groups. What we need to see is, from the Federal Government and the banking industry, to come together to create innovation sandboxes to start to use alternative data to expand to marginalized groups. Well, what about communities? Without community wealth, individual wealth, in a way, is on an island. And if you go into most major cities in the United States to most communities of color, what you'll find is underinvested communities. For every economic crisis, these communities have suffered severely. For every economic boom, they have not benefited. And so what we're seeing in a number of cities across the country, and I'll use Chicago as an example, is the partnerships occurring between banking institutions, philanthropists, the city and community leaders to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build community resources and communities that have historically been disinvested. Lastly, we've got to talk about business, and not just small businesses. Now, when you have individual stability and a banking institution, and you have access to credit, and when you have community wealth, those are all fantastic things, but we need also job creation. Take all of the new tech companies, and I say ""new"" because now they're not so new, but take Facebook, Google, Amazon. At some point, all of those companies were sole proprietorships with one employee or a few employees that were building a technology that was not yet proven. What those companies received early on was venture capital money. And when you look at venture capital today, only one percent of venture capital funds go to Black founders. So if Black entrepreneurs are largely shut out of those networks they're not able to grow, and the only way for that to change is from within the industry itself. In this generation, we must not only be talking about thriving businesses in Black communities. We must also be talking about seeing more Black-owned and founded businesses going public. Those are just four solutions. There's many other things that can and should be done to close the wealth gap. This gap is not new. It was born and perpetuated by federal policy, social constructs and business practice over time, and all of those things need to change to start to close the gap. Financial institutions play a really critical role at the individual level, at the community level and at the business level. It's important to our families, it's important to our communities and it's important to our economy. Instead of talking about how the gap continues to grow, let's begin to close the gap now. Thank you."
4:53,Elyse Cox,"Who owns the ""wilderness""?",Oct 2020,"In 1903, the President  of the United States took a three-day camping trip  in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept  in a grove of towering Sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours  talking around the campfire with his host and guide,  conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there  for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became  protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk  for overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old  struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use— two goals that were much easier  said than done. The battle over Yosemite began  with the 1849 gold rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold  in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In 1851, a state-sanctioned militia, drove the Ahwahneechee tribe  from Yosemite Valley. Those who managed to return witnessed  white settlers claiming the land, felling giant sequoias,  and building hotels and saloons. In response, a small group  of concerned Californians lobbied senator John Conness to protect  the valley from private interests. In 1864, Congress passed Conness’ bill, granting the Yosemite Valley  to the State of California, marking the first time the U.S. government brought land under public protection. But the management of that land remained  an open question, one that would only become  more complicated as more lands came  under similar protection. Seven years later, geologist Ferdinand Hayden led an expedition  to the Yellowstone Plateau, which many Native American tribes used  for ceremonies, hunting, and trade. The expedition’s scientists and artists  brought back news of spectacular geysers and hot springs, inspiring widespread support to bring  Yellowstone under government protection— and restrict native people’s  access to the land. However, unlike Yosemite, Yellowstone  couldn’t be granted to a state— it was part of three U.S. territories  that hadn’t become states yet. Instead, Congress brought Yellowstone  under federal stewardship in 1872, creating the world’s first true  National Park. During his presidency,  Teddy Roosevelt was instrumental in expanding the lands  under public protection. By 1916, there were  fifteen national parks. But the problem of management  remained unsolved, and maintenance of the park  was handled haphazardly over multiple government departments. Straightforward tasks like building roads  and hiring personnel required inefficient  bureaucratic maneuvering. None of the departments had set rules  for conduct in the park, so hunters killed park wildlife,  cattle overgrazed fields, and visitors vandalized landmarks. The solution came from Canada, which had a highly effective  centralized park service. In 1916, the United States established  the National Park Service based on this model. To this day, the mission for the park  service is comprised of two goals that sometimes conflict: to conserve the parks for the future and to allow the public to enjoy them. That’s a delicate balancing act:  roads, trails, and other infrastructure make the parks accessible to visitors,  but also alter the landscape, while visitors themselves can contribute  to pollution, erosion, and damage of delicate ecosystems. The very history of preservation  can also be at odds with this mission. Many parks were not,  at the time of their founding, the uninhabited wilderness that’s become  the standard for their preservation. Instead, many were homes or places  of worship for native peoples, who lost access to these lands  in the name of public use. Only recently has  the National Park Service begun to reckon with this legacy  and engage Native Americans in park management. Around the world, indigenous communities  play crucial roles in land management and preservation. Today, there are thousands  of national parks worldwide, and each must balance public use with  historical and ecological preservation. Parks in New Zealand, Iceland, Australia,  and South Africa have experienced severe erosion  as visitor numbers have skyrocketed. Some, like Mu Ko Similan National Park  in Thailand, have closed sections to tourists entirely  to allow the ecosystem to recover. National Parks have preserved  irreplaceable landscapes for future generations. They also force us to reckon  with hard questions: what are our responsibilities  to this planet, and to each other?"
6:10,Camilo Ramirez,The problem with the U.S. bail system,Sep 2020,"Since 2000, the annual number of people convicted of crimes in the United States has stayed steady, but the average number of people in jail each year has shot up. How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing  what it was intended to do. The term ""bail"" refers to the release of people awaiting trial on condition that they return  to court to face charges. Countries around the world  use many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily  on what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set  a reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee  in order to be released from jail until the court reached  a verdict on the case. Once the case ended,  whether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back  if they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system  is that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent until proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime  should not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption of innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights and causes serious harm, particularly to people  in low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail  to work as intended, the price has to be affordable for the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect the likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court  has not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances,  such as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail  and jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise  this power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny for using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail  became a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion  and prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher,  and more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise  of commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange for a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price  for almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan  from a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company  to decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think  will pay them back, turning a profit of about $2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main driver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands  of people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan stay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects Americans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused of the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent defendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes  they did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution  may offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward  the accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately— but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee  an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94%  of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization,  The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands of low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive that bail is designed to create. The result? People come back  to 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates  tended to because of circumstances like child care, work conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding people in jail before trial, often because they cannot afford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood of rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people  before their trials extends to entire communities and can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated  can lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted  of a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend  nearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people  who are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise  of equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail  are symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance on incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime,  reformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped  by cash bail and to create a more just and humane pretrial system for the future."
16:12,Neal Katyal,"How to win an argument (at the US Supreme Court, or anywhere)",Sep 2020,"Fourteen years ago, I stood in the Supreme Court to argue my first case. And it wasn't just any case, it was a case that experts called one of the most important cases the Supreme Court had ever heard. It considered whether Guantanamo was constitutional, and whether the Geneva Conventions applied to the war on terror. It was just a handful of years after the horrific attacks of September 11. The Supreme Court had seven Republican appointees and two Democratic ones, and my client happened to be Osama bin Laden's driver. My opponent was the Solicitor General of the United States, America's top courtroom lawyer. He had argued 35 cases. I wasn't even 35 years old. And to make matters worse, the Senate, for the first time since the Civil War, passed a bill to try and remove the case from the docket of the Supreme Court. Now the speaking coaches say I'm supposed to build tension and not tell you what happens. But the thing is, we won. How? Today, I'm going to talk about how to win an argument, at the Supreme Court or anywhere. The conventional wisdom is that you speak with confidence. That's how you persuade. I think that's wrong. I think confidence is the enemy of persuasion. Persuasion is about empathy, about getting into people's heads. That's what makes TED what it is. It's why you're listening to this talk. You could have read it on the cold page, but you didn't. Same thing with Supreme Court arguments -- we write written briefs with cold pages, but we also have an oral argument. We don't just have a system in which the justices write questions and you write answers. Why? Because argument is about interaction. I want to take you behind the scenes to tell you what I did, and how these lessons are generalizable. Not just for winning an argument in court, but for something far more profound. Now obviously, it's going to involve practice, but not just any practice will do. My first practice session for Guantanamo, I flew up to Harvard and had all these legendary professors throwing questions at me. And even though I had read everything, rehearsed a million times, I wasn't persuading anyone. My arguments weren't resonating. I was desperate. I had done everything possible, read every book, rehearsed a million times, and it wasn't going anywhere. So ultimately, I stumbled on this guy -- he was an acting coach, he wasn't even a lawyer. He'd never set foot in the Supreme Court. And he came into my office one day wearing a billowy white shirt and a bolo tie, and he looked at me with my folded arms and said, ""Look, Neal, I can tell that you don't think this is going to work, but just humor me. Tell me your argument."" So I grabbed my legal pad, and I started reading my argument. He said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""I'm telling you my argument."" He said, ""Your argument is a legal pad?"" I said, ""No, but my argument is on a legal pad."" He said, ""Neal, look at me. Tell me your argument."" And so I did. And instantly, I realized, my points were resonating. I was connecting to another human being. And he could see the smile starting to form as I was saying my words, and he said, ""OK, Neal. Now do your argument holding my hand."" And I said, ""What?"" And he said, ""Yeah, hold my hand."" I was desperate, so I did it. And I realized, ""Wow, that's connection. That's the power of how to persuade."" And it helped. But truthfully, I still got nervous as the argument date approached. And I knew that even though argument was about getting into someone else's shoes and empathizing, I needed to have a solid core first. So I did something outside of my comfort zone. I wore jewelry -- not just anything, but a bracelet that my father had worn his whole life, until he passed away, just a few months before the argument. I put on a tie that my mom had given me just for the occasion. And I took out my legal pad and wrote my children's names on it, because that's why I was doing this. For them, to leave the country better than I had found it. I got to court, and I was calm. The bracelet, the tie, the children's names had all centered me. Like a rock climber extending beyond the precipice, if you have a solid hold, you can reach out. And because argument is about persuasion, I knew I had to avoid emotion. Displays of emotion fail. It's kind of like writing an email in all bold and all caps. It persuades no one. It's then about you, the speaker, not about the listener or the receiver. Now look, in some settings, the solution is to be emotional. You're arguing with your parents, and you use emotion and it works. Why? Because your parents love you. But Supreme Court justices don't love you. They don't like to think of themselves as the type of people persuaded by emotion. And I reverse engineered that insight too, setting a trap for my opponent to provoke his emotional reaction, so I could be seen as the calm and steady voice of the law. And it worked. And I remember sitting in the courtroom to learn that we had won. That the Guantanamo tribunals were coming down. And I went out onto the courthouse steps and there was a media firestorm. Five hundred cameras, and they're all asking me, ""What does the decision mean, what does it say?"" Well, the decision was 185 pages long. I hadn't had time to read it, nobody had. But I knew what it meant. And here's what I said on the steps of the Court. ""Here's what happened today. You have the lowest of the low -- this guy, who was accused of being bin Laden's driver, one of the most horrible men around. And he sued not just anyone, but the nation, indeed, the world's most powerful man, the president of the United States. And he brings it not in some rinky-dink traffic court, but in the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court of the United States ... And he wins. That's something remarkable about this country. In many other countries, this driver would have been shot, just for bringing his case. And more of the point for me, his lawyer would have been shot. But that's what makes America different. What makes America special."" Because of that decision, the Geneva conventions apply to the war on terror, which meant the end of ghost prisons worldwide, the end of waterboarding worldwide and an end to those Guantanamo military tribunals. By methodically building the case, and getting into the justices' heads, we were able to quite literally change the world. Sounds easy, right? You can practice a lot, avoid displays of emotion, and you, too, can win any argument. I'm sorry to say, it's not that simple, my strategies aren't foolproof, and while I've won more Supreme Court cases than most anyone, I've also lost a lot too. Indeed, after Donald Trump was elected, I was, constitutionally speaking, terrified. Please understand, this is not about Left versus Right, or anything like that. I'm not here to talk about that. But just a week in to the new president's term, you might remember those scenes at the airports. President Trump had campaigned on a pledge, saying, quote, ""I, Donald J. Trump am calling for a complete and total shutdown of all Muslim immigration to the United States."" And he also said, quote, ""I think Islam hates us."" And he made good on that promise, banning immigration from seven countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations. My legal team and others went into court right away and sued, and got that first travel ban struck down. Trump revised it. We went into court again and got that struck down. He revised it again, and changed it, adding North Korea, because we all know, the United States had a tremendous immigration problem with North Korea. But it did enable his lawyers to go to the Supreme Court and say, ""See, this isn't discriminating against Muslims, it includes these other people too."" Now I thought we had the killer answer to that. I won't bore you with the details, but the thing is, we lost. Five votes to four. And I was devastated. I was worried my powers of persuasion had waned. And then, two things happened. The first was, I noticed a part of the Supreme Court's travel ban opinion that discussed the Japanese American interment. That was a horrific moment in our history, in which over 100,000 Japanese Americans had been interned in camps. My favorite person to challenge this scheme was Gordon Hirabayashi, a University of Washington student. He turned himself in to the FBI, who said, ""Look, you're a first-time offender, you can go home."" And Gordon said, ""No, I'm a Quaker, I have to resist unjust laws,"" and so they arrested him and he was convicted. Gordon's case made it to the Supreme Court. And again, I'm going to do that thing where I quash any sense of anticipation you have, and tell you what happened. Gordon lost. But he lost because of a simple reason. Because the Solicitor General, that top courtroom lawyer for the government, told the Supreme Court that the Japanese American internment was justified by military necessity. And that was so, even though his own staff had discovered that there was no need for the Japanese American interment and that the FBI and the intelligence community all believed that. And indeed, that it was motivated by racial prejudice. His staff begged the Solicitor General, ""Tell the truth, don't suppress evidence."" What did the Solicitor General do? Nothing. He went in and told the ""military necessity"" story. And so the Court upheld Gordon Hirabayashi's conviction. And the next year, upheld Fred Korematsu's interment. Now why was I thinking about that? Because nearly 70 years later, I got to hold the same office, Head of the Solicitor General's Office. And I got to set the record straight, explaining that the government had misrepresented the facts in the Japanese interment cases. And when I thought about the Supreme Court's travel ban opinion, I realized something. The Supreme Court, in that opinion, went out of its way to overrule the Korematsu case. Now, not only had the Justice Department said the Japanese interment was wrong, the Supreme Court said so too. That's a crucial lesson about arguments -- timing. All of you, when you're arguing, have that important lever to play. When do you make your argument? You don't just need the right argument, you need the right argument at the right moment. When is it that your audience -- a spouse, a boss, a child -- is going to be most receptive? Now look, sometimes, it's totally out of your control. Delay has costs that are too extensive. And so you've got to go in and fight and you very well may, like me, get the timing wrong. That's what we thought in the travel ban. And you see, the Supreme Court wasn't ready, so early in President Trump's term, to overrule his signature initiative, just as it wasn't ready to overrule FDR's Japanese American interment. And sometimes, you just have to take the risk. But it is so painful when you lose. And patience is really hard. But that reminds me of the second lesson. Even if vindication comes later, I realized how important the fight now is, because it inspires, because it educates. I remember reading a column by Ann Coulter about the Muslim ban. Here's what she said. ""Arguing against Trump was first-generation American, Neal Katyal. There are plenty of 10th-generation America-haters. You couldn't get one of them to argue we should end our country through mass-immigration?"" And that's when emotion, which is so anathema to a good argument, was important to me. It took emotion outside the courtroom to get me back in. When I read Coulter's words, I was angry. I rebel against the idea that being a first-generation American would disqualify me. I rebel against the idea that mass immigration would end this country, instead of recognizing that as literally the rock on which this country was built. When I read Coulter, I thought about so many things in my past. I thought about my dad, who arrived here with eight dollars from India, and didn't know whether to use the colored bathroom or the white one. I thought about his first job offer, at a slaughter house. Not a great job for a Hindu. I thought about how, when we moved to a new neighborhood in Chicago with one other Indian family, that family had a cross  burned on its lawn. Because the racists aren't very good at distinguishing between African Americans and Hindus. And I thought about  all the hate mail I got during Guantanamo, for being a Muslim lover. Again, the racists aren't very good with distinctions between Hindus and Muslims, either. Ann Coulter thought that being the child of an immigrant was a weakness. She was profoundly, profoundly wrong. It is my strength, because I knew what America was supposed to stand for. I knew that in America, me, a child of a man who came here with eight dollars in his pocket, could stand in the Supreme Court of the United States on behalf of a detested foreigner, like Osama bin Laden's driver, and win. And it made me realize, even though I may have lost the case, I was right about the Muslim ban too. No matter what the court decided, they couldn't change the fact that immigrants do strengthen this country. Indeed, in many ways, immigrants love this country the most. When I read Ann Coulter's words, I thought about the glorious words of our Constitution. The First Amendment. Congress shall make no law establishing religion. I thought about our national creed, ""E plurbis unum,"" ""out of many come one."" Most of all, I realized, the only way you can truly lose an argument is by giving up. So I joined the lawsuit by the US Congress challenging President Trump's addition of a citizenship question to the census. A decision with huge implications. It was a really hard case. Most thought we would lose. But the thing is, we won. Five votes to four. The Supreme Court basically said President Trump and his cabinet's secretary had lied. And now I've gotten back up and rejoined the fight, and I hope each of you, in your own ways, does so too. I'm getting back up because I'm a believer that good arguments do win out in the end. The arc of justice is long, and bends, often, slowly, but it bends so long as we bend it. And I've realized the question is not how to win every argument. It's how to get back up when you do lose. Because in the long run, good arguments will win out. If you make a good argument, it has the power to outlive you, to stretch beyond your core, to reach those future minds. And that's why all of this is so important. I'm not telling you how to win arguments for the sake of winning arguments. This isn't a game. I'm telling you this because even if you don't win right now, if you make a good argument, history will prove you right. I think back to that acting coach all the time. And I've come to realize that the hand I was holding was the hand of justice. That outstretched hand will come for you. It's your decision to push it away or to keep holding it. Thank you so much for listening."
16:37,Joseph Shin,How doctors can help fix the broken US asylum system,Aug 2020,"Several years ago a young man came to see me in my clinic. He told me he was running for his life. He said that he fled his home, because there, homosexuality wasn't just illegal, in some cases it was punishable by death. So when his sexual orientation was exposed, his family rejected him, his boss fired him and angry mobs repeatedly attacked him in the streets. And each time the police arrived only to arrest him, detain and torture him further. And he knew that if he couldn't escape the cycle of violence, he would surely be killed. So he had to do what he needed to do to survive. He left everything behind. All of his friends, his family, his career. He fled his home, he escaped to the United States and here he applied for asylum. But like many people fleeing this kind of persecution, he couldn't carry much. He had some basic ID, barely any money and a few other belongings. He certainly didn't bring official documents from the police who tortured him. No videos from the mob that tried to kill him. He didn't have this kind of evidence to help support his claims, yet here he was, sitting in my clinic, showing me some of the most powerful evidence of his persecution. That was the physical and psychological scars that he brought with him. You see, he suffered from chronic, debilitating pain. He had severe scars scattered over his body, poorly healing wounds that got infected over and over again. He suffered from severe depression and continued to have regular, paralyzing flashbacks and nightmares from PTSD. So we continued our work. We met regularly for months, documenting each of these pieces of medical evidence. We went over the details of every attack, photographed his scars, documented his injuries and wounds, and we were even able to start chronicling his slow but steady recovery while under our care. Working closely with his lawyers, I submitted a detailed affidavit, including the findings of this forensic medical evaluation, and we included it as part of his asylum application. And then we waited for several long years while he navigated the courts. And then one day I got an email from him. It said that he was granted asylum. And everyone in the clinic was overjoyed. He said in his email that this was the first time in years that he didn't fear deportation and death. It was the first time in years that he truly felt safe, that he had the security to rebuild his life all over again. And it was only through this medical and legal advocacy that we were able to help restore his legal status and his rights, that he could do that, all through asylum. Now for many people fleeing persecution, they come to programs and clinics like this telling unimaginable tales of violence and different reasons they were persecuted. But one thing is always the same. The violence meted against them was done with complete impunity, sometimes by the hands of the state directly through police or military officials. In other cases, the state just turns a blind eye and condones the acts of paramilitary groups or even violent domestic partners. In other cases, state is completely powerless to protect the vulnerable from powerful gangs. Now we know that social determinants of health play a huge role in determining the health and well-being of our patients: housing, income, education, race, social inclusion. But the same can be true for equal protection in the law -- due process. Especially in societies for the most vulnerable, the marginalized and even those who are actively targeted, their access to these human rights protections that can mean the difference between sickness and health, and often it's the difference between life and death. And for millions of people who endure persecution and torture, the only way to heal is to acknowledge the human rights abuses that have occurred and to help restore the rights and protections that were so violated. After the atrocities of World War II, the asylum system was set up as one pathway to that kind of relief. But these days it seems like that pathway has turned into an obstacle course, setting people up to fail. Asylum seekers oftentimes don't know how to start, let alone complete the process that can drag on for years. They're not entitled to lawyers, so they don't know their rights. Increasingly, they're even being barred from setting foot in places of potential refuge. They're arrested or prosecuted, even deported before they ever get to see an asylum officer. And even if they do make it through the process, asylum grant rates can be as low as 20 percent and far worse for some. It's almost like the system was designed to keep people from exercising their right. But there is something that many of these people can do. Something that can potentially increase their chances of success to 90 percent or more. So what makes the difference? Getting a lawyer and having a medical evaluation. It's as simple as that. The man who came to my clinic and won his asylum case. Doctors and lawyers working together to present all of the evidence, including the medical evidence, to the courts allows judges to make informed and just decisions. And it's this kind of medical-legal partnership that's now more important than ever, because we live in a time of epic, forced migration due to violence and conflict. In 2018 there were 70 million people worldwide forcibly displaced due to war, conflict and persecution. It includes 40 million internally displaced, 25 million refugees and three million asylum seekers. Here in the United States, we see the impact of escalating violence in places like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where murder rates can be as high as those in Syria and Afghanistan. Where police corruption and gang violence are on the rise, where poverty and child abuse are widespread and tolerated, where basic systems of governance -- public safety, child protection -- are ineffective. It's no surprise then that many of the most vulnerable in some of these societies -- children, women and other targeted groups -- they're growing increasingly desperate and fleeing in unprecedented numbers. Like over the past 10 years, the numbers of unaccompanied children trying to seek safety at our southwest border has increased 18-fold, from 3,300 in 2009 to over 62,000 this past year. That's in addition to nearly half a million people traveling as families. Men, women and children trying to seek refuge at our borders, but who are stranded in a humanitarian crisis. And what makes matters worse is that they're caught in this fog of claims and counterclaims about who they are, what they've experienced, where the proof is and what they deserve. Do they deserve our help? Sometimes people make claims that they're not fleeing human rights abuses but are simply economic migrants. Others say these children are actually being exploited and trafficked by their parents. Others say they're not even children at all; they're hardened criminals, they're gang members trying to infiltrate our country. To cut through some of this fog, my colleagues and I conducted a study. We looked at data from children seeking asylum who had medical evaluations. And this is what the evidence told us. 80 percent of these children had evidence of exposure to repeated physical violence: assault and torture. 60 percent of the girls and at least 10 percent of the boys had evidence of repeated exposure to sexual violence. One young girl, telling a story and having corroborating evidence of being detained, beaten and raped over the course of three years, trafficked to other men and even having the threats of the murder of her entire family if she should ever escape or try to seek help. 90 percent of these children had evidence of psychological harm from indirect violence, including such severe threats, but also witnessing untold atrocities with their very eyes. One young boy described the terror and the grief and the utter fear of seeing the mutilated bodies and faces of his younger brother, his aunt, his uncle, his cousin, all killed in a single gang attack meant to send the community a message. And of course the psychological toll is immense. 19 percent of these children had signs of anxiety disorder; 41 percent, depression and 64 percent, PTSD. 21 percent also had signs of suicidality as children. To put this into some perspective, returning combat veterans, they have PTSD on the order of 10 to 20 percent. These children at three to six times more likely to have PTSD than a soldier returning from war. Now despite this burden and despite this trauma, there are many others, still. Children who come to seek safety and enter into our immigration system only to find further abuse and even torture reminiscent of the places that they fled. You might remember some of those headlines, some of those images this past year. Children being ripped from the arms of their parents. Toddlers, infants in cold and unsanitary cages. The absence of food, water clothing and even soap. There's also increasing reports of medical negligence, preventable complications, child abuse, sexual abuse and even child deaths in US custody. Sadly, many of these abuses and crimes aren't new. Some date back many years and even across administrations. But something's changed. The scope and scale of these abuses and crimes, the systematic and seemingly purposeful endangerment of asylum seekers and also the impunity with which it's being done has raised the harm to an entirely new level. It reminds me of one of the girls in the study who told us how she pleaded with one of her attackers, asking him to stop, asking why she was targeted. And do you what his response was? He says, ""We can do this, because there's no one here to protect you."" We can't let this be true of children and other asylum seekers trying to find help at our borders. But what do we do? As a physician, I'm often dealing with difficult decisions with some of my sickest and most complex patients. Of course we want to keep our focus on their health, their well-being, their quality of life, but sometimes it requires a deeper exploration of their values to really understand how to move forward. In a similar way, our nation is facing a crisis with the increasing number of asylum seekers at our borders and in our communities, and it compels us to re-examine some of our own fundamental values. What does it mean when we value health and safety? What does it mean when we value security, life, liberty, the life of children? What about this one -- what does it mean when we say we value law and order? Does that also include respecting due process rights for an asylum seeker? Now for some, when they hear these terms they immediately gravitate towards wanting to build more walls, deploying more border patrol, deporting more people even if it means separating children from their families, subjecting them to psychological torture or deporting them to places where they might die. All in the name of security. All in our name. But for me and for many others, when I think of these values, that pushes me in an entirely new direction and renews my commitment to try to meet the needs of these asylum seekers with every tool I have at my disposal. So that when we say that we value life and liberty, we'll see these people who have taken unimaginable risks to flee imminent danger and harm to try to find safety. We'll meet them where they are and provide food, water, shelter, clothing. And we'll certainly meet them with medical care and mental health care that they so desperately need. When we say that we value the rule of law, and not just the privileges it provides a few but the responsibilities it requires of all of us, we'll make sure that we have a functioning immigration system. We'll make sure that we have trained judges. We'll make sure that we're not settling for the illusion of law and order that maybe a tall wall or a militarized border might provide us. We want the real thing. We want judges to be able to evaluate the evidence, including the medical evidence, and we want them to administer justice ... fairly. When we say that we value health and well-being, that we don't want to perpetuate harm, then we'll deploy trauma-informed strategies at all levels of the immigration system. It might start with retraining border patrol agents or immigration officials, but it needs more medical, mental health and child welfare experts across the whole system. And when we say that we value justice, we won't let ourselves be turned into the torturers that many of these children and other people fled. We'll open up our detention centers and our courts to experts and advocates to hold ourselves accountable. And we may find that we need to shut down most of them and close these camps. I believe that by working in effective partnerships with lawyers, doctors, human rights advocates and many others, that we can work together to meet these asylum seekers' needs, that we can meet our historical, humanitarian and legal obligations to them. And when we do, I think something powerful will unfold. Not only will these asylum seekers -- like the man who came to my clinic and won his asylum case, like the children in the study or the many thousands of others seeking a new life, they'll be able to find that safety and security. We'll recognize the abuses that have occurred, and we'll restore the rights and protections that were lost. And I think that we'll be in wonder when we see them in the fullness of their humanity. Not just their strengths and weaknesses, their hopes and joys, not just the trauma that we acknowledge, but we'll also stand with them and we'll be inspired by their resilience. They'll blossom, and they'll add to the richness of this nation. I think by staying true to our fundamental values in the way that I've described, that's how we build a sane and humane immigration system. That's how we remain the golden door. And that's how it happens that we remain the shining light of the world. Thank you. (Applause)"
8:48,Jose Antonio Vargas,3 questions to ask yourself about US citizenship,Aug 2020,"Four years after arriving in the United States, like any typical 16-year-old, I went to get my driver's permit. After I showed the clerk my immigration papers, my green card, she told me it was fake. ""Don't come back here again,"" she said. That's how I found out I was in America illegally. And I'm still here illegally. I'm a journalist and filmmaker. I live in stories. And what I've learned that what most people don't understand about immigration is what they don't understand about themselves: their families' old migration stories and the processes they had to go through before green cards and walls even existed, or what shaped their understanding of citizenship itself. I was born in the Philippines. When I was 12, my mother sent me to live with her parents, my grandparents, or, as we say in Tagalog, lolo and lola. Lolo's name was Teofilo. When he legally emigrated to America and became a naturalized citizen, he changed his name from Teofilo to Ted, after Ted Danson from the TV show ""Cheers."" Can't get any more American than that. Lolo's favorite song was Frank Sinatra's ""My Way,"" and when it came to figuring out how to get his only grandson, me, to America, he decided to do it his way. According to Lolo, there was no easy and simple way to get me here, so Lolo saved up 4,500 dollars -- that's a lot of money for a security guard who made no more than eight dollars an hour -- to pay for the fake green card and for a smuggler to bring me to the US. So that's how I got here. I can't tell you how many times people tell me that their ancestors came to America ""the right way,"" to which I remind them, America's definition of ""the right way"" has been changing ever since the first ship of settlers dropped anchor. America as we know it is more than a piece of land, particularly because the land that now makes up the United States of America used to belong to other people in other countries. America as we know it is also more than a nation of immigrants. There are two groups of Americans who are not immigrants: Native Americans, who were indigenous to this land and who were killed in acts of genocide; and African Americans, who were kidnapped, shipped and enslaved to build this country. America is, above all, an idea, however unrealized and imperfect, one that only exists because the first settlers came here freely without worry of citizenship. So, where did you come from? How did you get here? Who paid? All across America, in front of diverse audiences -- conservatives and progressives, high school students and senior citizens -- I've asked those questions. As a person of color, I always get asked where I'm from, as in, ""Where are you from from?"" So I've asked white people where they're from from, too. After asking a student at the University of Georgia where he was from, he said, ""I'm American."" ""I know,"" I said, ""but where are you from?"" ""I'm white,"" he replied. ""But white is not a country,"" I said. ""Where are your ancestors from?"" When he replied with a shrug, I said, ""Well, where did you come from? How did you get here? Who paid?"" He couldn't answer. I don't think you can talk about America as America without answering those three core questions. Immigration is America's lifeline, how this country has replenished itself for centuries, from the settlers and the revolutionaries who populated the original 13 colonies to the millions of immigrants, predominantly from Europe, who relentlessly colonized this land. Even though Native Americans were already here and had their own tribal identities and ideas about citizenship, they were not considered US citizens until the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act. The landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act that Black Americans fought for inspired the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which ended America's race-based exclusionary system that had lasted for 40 years. I could go on and on here, but my point, my larger point, is this: How much do any of us, whether immigrants of the past or the present, know of these crucial parts of American history? How much of this history makes up the actual US citizenship test? Have you ever seen it? It's a mostly oral test, and government officers ask applicants up to 10 of the 100 questions. To pass, applicants must get at least six answers right. I looked at the test recently, and I was aghast at the questions posed and what constitutes acceptable answers to the glaring omissions. There's a question about the Statue of Liberty and where it is. There's no question about Ellis Island, about the United States as an immigrant nation and the countless anti-immigrant laws that were passed. There's nothing about Native American history. There's a question about what Martin Luther King, Jr. did, but largely, there's inadequate and irresponsible contexts about African Americans. Here's an example. Question number 74 under the American history section asks applicants to ""name one problem that led to the Civil War."" There are three acceptable answers: slavery, states' rights, economic reasons. Did my Lola and Lolo get that question? If they did get the question, do they even understand the history behind it? How about my uncles and aunties and cousins and millions of other immigrants who had to take that test to become Americans? What do immigrants know about America before we get here? What kind of citizenship are we applying for? And is that the same kind of citizenship we actually want to be a part of? Come to think of it -- I've been thinking a lot about this -- what does dignified citizenship look like? How can I ask for it when I just arrived here 26 years ago, when Black and Native people who have been here in America for hundreds of years are still waiting for theirs? One of my favorite writers is Toni Morrison. In 1996, a year before I found out I was in the country illegally, my eighth-grade class was assigned to read ""The Bluest Eye,"" Morrison's first book. Instantly, the book challenged me to ask hard questions. Why does Pecola Breedlove, this young Black girl at the center of the book, why did she want blue eyes? Who told her to want it? Why did she believe them? Morrison said she wrote the book to illustrate what happens when a person surrenders to what she called ""the master narrative."" ""Definitions,"" Morrison said, ""belong to the definers, not the defined."" Once I realized that I was here illegally, I convinced myself that if I was not a legal citizen by birth or by law, another kind of citizenship was possible. Citizenship as participation: I engage. I engage with all kinds of Americans, even Americans who don't want me here. Citizenship as contribution: I give back to my community in whatever ways I can. As an undocumented entrepreneur -- and yes, there is such a thing -- I've employed many US citizens. Citizenship as education: We can't wait for others to educate us about the past and how we got to this present. We have to educate ourselves and our circles. Citizenship as something greater than myself: We are, I think, individually and collectively, rewriting the master narrative of America. The people who were once defined are now doing the defining. They're asking the questions that need to be asked. A core part of that redefinition is how we define not only who is an American but what constitutes citizenship. Which, to me, is our responsibility to each other. So consider your own personal narrative and ask yourself: Where did you come from? How did you get here? Who paid?"
36:20,"William ""Sandy"" Darity",A blueprint for reparations in the US,Jul 2020,
14:51,Thomas Abt,Why violence clusters in cities — and how to reduce it,Jul 2020,"You are a trauma surgeon, working in the midnight shift in an inner city emergency room. A young man is wheeled in before you, lying unconscious on a gurney. He's been shot in the leg and is bleeding profusely. Judging from the entry and exit wounds, as well as the amount of hemorrhaging, the bullet most likely clipped the femoral artery, one of the largest blood vessels in the body. As the young man's doctor, what should you do? Or more precisely, what should you do first? You look at the young man's clothes, which seem old and worn. He may be jobless, homeless, lacking a decent education. Do you start treatment by finding him a job, getting him an apartment or helping him earn his GED? On the other hand, this young man has been involved in some sort of conflict and may be dangerous. Before he wakes up, do you place him in restraints, alert hospital security or call 911? Most of us wouldn't do any of these things. And instead, we would take the only sensible and humane course of action available at the time. First, we would stop the bleeding. Because unless we stop the bleeding, nothing else matters. What's true in the emergency room is true for cities all around the country. When it comes to urban violence, the first priority is to save lives. Treating that violence with the same urgency that we would treat a gunshot wound in the ER. What are we talking about when we say ""urban violence""? Urban violence is the lethal or potentially lethal violence that happens on the streets of our cities. It goes by many names: street violence, youth violence, gang violence, gun violence. Urban violence happens among the most disadvantaged and disenfranchised among us. Mostly young men, without a lot of options or much hope. I have spent hundreds of hours with these young men. I've taught them at a high school in Washington DC, where one of my students was murdered. I've stood across form them in courtrooms in New York City, where I worked as a prosecutor. And finally, I've gone from city to city as a policymaker and as a researcher, meeting with these young men and exchanging ideas on how to make our communities safer. Why should we care about these young men? Why does urban violence matter? Urban violence matters, because it causes more deaths here in the United States than any other form of violence. Urban violence also matters because we can actually do something about it. Controlling it is not the impossible, intractable challenge that many believe it to be. In fact, there are a number of solutions available today that are proven to work. And what these solutions have in common is one key ingredient. They all recognize that urban violence is sticky, meaning that it clusters together among a surprisingly small number of people and places. In New Orleans, for instance, a network of fewer than 700 individuals accounts for the majority of the city's lethal violence. Some call these individuals ""hot people."" Here in Boston, 70 percent of shootings are concentrated on blocks and corners covering just five percent of the city. These locations are often known as ""hot spots."" In city after city, a small number of hot people and hot spots account for the clear majority of lethal violence. In fact, this finding has been replicated so many times that researchers now call this phenomenon the law of crime concentration. When we look at the science, we see that sticky solutions work best. To put it bluntly, you can't stop shootings if you won't deal with shooters. And you can't stop killings if you won't go where people get killed. Four years ago, my colleagues and I performed a systematic meta-review of antiviolence strategies, summarizing the results of over 1,400 individual impact evaluations. What we found, again and again, was that the strategies that were the most focused, the most targeted, the stickiest strategies, were the most successful. We saw this in criminology, in studies of policing, gang prevention and reentry. But we also saw this in public health, where targeted tertiary and secondary prevention performed better than more generalized primary prevention. When policymakers focus on the most dangerous people and places, they get better results. What about replacement and displacement, you might ask. Research shows that when drug dealers are locked up, new dealers step right in, replacing those that came before. Some worry that when police focus on certain locations, crime will be displaced, moving down the street or around the corner. Fortunately, we know now that because of the stickiness phenomenon, the replacement and displacement effects associated with these sticky strategies are minimal. It takes a lifetime of trauma to create a shooter and decades of disinvestment to create a hot spot. So these people and places don't move around easily. What about root causes? Isn't addressing poverty or inequality or lack of opportunity the best way to prevent violence? Well, according to the science, yes and no. Yes, in that high rates of violence are clearly associated with various forms of social and economic disadvantage. But no, in that changes in these factors do not necessarily result in changes in violence, especially not in the short run. Take poverty, for instance. Meaningful progress on poverty will take decades to achieve, while poor people need and deserve relief from violence right now. Root causes also can't explain the stickiness phenomenon. If poverty always drove violence, then we would expect to see violence among all poor people. But we don't see that. Instead, we can empirically observe that poverty concentrates, crime concentrates further still and violence concentrates most of all. That is why sticky solutions work. They work, because they deal with first things first. And this is important, because while poverty may lead to violence, strong evidence shows that violence actually perpetuates poverty. Here's just one example of how. As documented by Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist -- he showed that when poor children are exposed to violence, it traumatizes them. It impacts their ability to sleep, to pay attention, to behave and to learn. And if poor children can't learn, then they can't do well in school. And that ultimately impacts their ability to earn a paycheck later in life that is large enough to escape poverty. And unfortunately, in a series of landmark studies by economist Raj Chetty, that is exactly what we've seen. Poor children exposed to violence have lower income mobility than poor children who grow up peacefully. Violence literally traps poor kids in poverty. That is why it is so important to focus relentlessly on urban violence. Here are two examples of how. Here in Boston, in the 1990s, a partnership between cops and community members achieved a stunning 63 percent reduction in youth homicide. In Oakland, that same strategy recently reduced nonfatal gun assaults by 55 percent. In Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Haven, it cut gun violence by more than a third. At its simplest, this strategy simply identifies those who are most likely to shoot or be shot, and then confronts them with a double message of empathy and accountability. ""We know it's you that's doing the shooting. It must stop. If you let us, we will help you. If you make us, we will stop you."" Those willing to change are offered services and support. Those who persist in their violent behavior are brought to justice via targeted law enforcement action. In Chicago, another program uses cognitive behavioral therapy to help teenage boys manage difficult thoughts and emotions, by teaching them how to avoid or mitigate conflicts. This program reduced violent crime arrests among participants by half. Similar strategies have reduced criminal reoffending by 25 to 50 percent. Now Chicago has launched a new effort, using these same techniques, but with those at the highest risk for gun violence. And the program is showing promising results. What's more, because these strategies are so focused, so targeted, they tend not to cost much in absolute terms. And they work with the laws already on the books today. So that's the good news. We can have peace in our cities, right now, without big budgets and without new laws. So why hasn't this happened yet? Why are these solutions still limited to a small number of cities, and why do they struggle, even when successful, to maintain support? Well, that's the bad news. The truth is, we have not been very good at organizing our efforts around this phenomenon of stickiness. There are at least three reasons why we don't follow the evidence when it comes to urban violence reduction. And the first, as you might expect, is politics. Most sticky solutions don't conform to one political platform or another. Instead, they offer both carrots and sticks, balancing the promise of treatment with the threat of arrest, combining place-based investment with hot-spots policing. In other words, these solutions are both soft and tough at the same time. Because they don't line up neatly with the typical talking points of either the Left or the Right, politicians won't gravitate to these ideas without some education, and maybe even a little pressure. It won't be easy, but we can change the politics around these issues by reframing violence as a problem to be solved, not an argument to be won. We should emphasize evidence over ideology and what works versus what sounds good. The second reason why we don't always follow the evidence is the somewhat complicated nature of these solutions. There is an irony here. What are the simplest ways to reduce violence? More cops. More jobs. Fewer guns. These are easy to spell out, but they tend not to work as well in practice. While on the other hand, research-based solutions are harder to explain, but get better results. Right now, we have a lot of professors writing about violence in academic journals. And we have a lot of people keeping us safe out on the street. But what we don't have is a lot of communication between these two groups. We don't have a strong bridge between research and practice. And when research actually does inform practice, that bridge is not built by accident. It happens when someone takes the time to carefully explain what the research means, why it's important and how it can actually make a difference in the field. We spend plenty of time creating research, but not enough breaking it down into bite-sized bits that a busy cop or social worker can easily digest. It may be difficult to acknowledge or accept, but race is the third and final reason why more has not been done to reduce violence. Urban violence concentrates among poor communities of color. That makes it easy for those of us who don't live in those communities to ignore the problem or pretend it's not ours to solve. That is wrong, of course. Urban violence is everyone's problem. Directly or indirectly, we all pay a price for the shootings and killings that happen on the streets of our cities. That is why we need to find new ways to motivate more people to cross class and color lines to join this struggle. Because these strategies are not resource-intensive, we don't need to motivate many new allies -- we just need a few. And we just need them to be loud. If we can overcome these challenges and spread these sticky solutions to the neighborhoods that need them, we could save thousands of lives. If the strategies I've discussed here today were implemented right now in the nation's 40 most violent cities, we could save over 12,000 souls over the next eight years. How much would it cost? About 100 million per year. That might sound like a lot, but in fact, that figure represents less than one percent of one percent of the annual federal budget. The Defense Department spends about that much for a single F-35 fighter jet. Metaphorically, the treatment is the same, whether it's a young man suffering from a gunshot wound, a community riddled with such wounds, or a nation filled with such communities. In each case, the treatment, first and foremost, is to stop the bleeding. I know this can work. I know it, because I've seen it. I've seen shooters put down their guns and devote their lives to getting others to do the same. I've walked through housing projects that were notorious for gunfire and witnessed children playing outside. I've sat with cops and community members who used to hate one another, but now work together. And I've seen people from all walks of life, people like you, finally decide to get involved in this struggle. And that's why I know that together, we can and we will end this senseless slaughter. Thank you. (Applause)"
4:54,Rod Phillips,What happened when the United States tried to ban alcohol,Jul 2020,"On January 17, 1920, six armed men  robbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits  had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands  of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended  consequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production  and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels  of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure  during World War I. But the view in the Western world  of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills  was much older. It first gained traction  during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers  poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups called temperance movements began to appear in the United States  and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed  that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty  and domestic violence, and set out to convince  governments of this. While some simply advocated  moderate drinking, many believed alcohol  should be banned entirely. These movements drew support  from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active  participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities,  especially Protestants, denounced alcohol  as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists  believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers  to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada,  white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting  these communities— though there were many other  destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations  and on reservation land. American temperance movements gained their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states  banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment  to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale,  and transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban  personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity  to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries,  breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups  rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market  in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side  with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular  political faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars,  known as ""speakeasies,"" began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars  to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol  at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s  prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol  from being consumed, the government required manufacturers to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol  wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition  had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political  corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall,  the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great  Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition  would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol  was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely  didn’t work, the health and social impacts  of alcohol remain concerns today."
6:03,Dustin Tahmahkera,The last chief of the Comanches and the fall of an empire,Jul 2020,"Late one night in 1871, a group of riders  descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp  into a panic, stole about 70 horses, and disappeared. Led by a young chief  named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest  in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier  between the indigenous people known as the Numunu,  or Comanches, and the United States forces sent  to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie  led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel  drew near his targets, they disappeared without  a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled  this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican  attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land  by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’  bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not  one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands,  each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common  was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child  was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both  other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie  faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah  was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band,  and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village,  capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought  refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah  proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young  woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father  and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing  Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band  was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast  market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions  of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led  a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s  1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender,  Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced  certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah  and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation  in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers, they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life  on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised rations and supplies, but what they provided  was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly  in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power  compared to others who had been  on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect  for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement  leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction  of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges  on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint  one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed  outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported  Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders  had supported him to lead them against  the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary,  Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies  and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American  Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker,  adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down  his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both  died shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again— to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem  insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics,  after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official  in the tribe, recognizing him  as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural  survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens  and countless descendants."
51:14,Ibram X. Kendi,"The difference between being ""not racist"" and antiracist",Jun 2020,"Cloe Shasha: So welcome, Ibram, and thank you so much for joining us. Ibram X. Kendi: Well, thank you, Cloe, and Whitney, and thank you everyone for joining this conversation. And so, a few weeks ago, on the same day we learned about the brutal murder of George Floyd, we also learned that a white woman in Central Park who chose not to leash her dog and was told by a black man nearby that she needed to leash her dog, instead decided to threaten this black male, instead decided to call the police and claim that her life was being threatened. And of course, when we learned about that through a video, many Americans were outraged, and this woman, Amy Cooper, ended up going on national TV and saying, like countless other Americans have said right after they engaged in a racist act, ""I am not racist."" And I say countless Americans, because when you really think about the history of Americans expressing racist ideas, supporting racist policies, you're really talking about a history of people who have claimed they're not racist, because everyone claims that they're not racist, whether we're talking about the Amy Coopers of the world, whether we're talking about Donald Trump, who, right after he said that majority-black Baltimore is a rat and rodent-infested mess that no human being would want to live in, and he was challenged as being racist, he said, ""Actually, I'm the least racist person anywhere in the world."" And so really the heartbeat of racism itself has always been denial, and the sound of that heartbeat has always been, ""I'm not racist."" And so what I'm trying to do with my work is to really get Americans to eliminate the concept of ""not racist"" from their vocabulary, and realize we're either being racist or anti-racist. We're either expressing ideas that suggest certain racial groups are better or worse than others, superior or inferior than others. We're either being racist, or we're being anti-racist. We're expressing notions that the racial groups are equals, despite any cultural or even ethnic differences. We're either supporting policies that are leading to racial inequities and injustice, like we saw in Louisville, where Breonna Taylor was murdered, or we're supporting policies and pushing policies that are leading to justice and equity for all. And so I think we should be very clear about whether we're expressing racist ideas, about whether we're supporting racist policies, and admit when we are, because to be anti-racist is to admit when we expressed a racist idea, is to say, ""You know what? When I was doing that in Central Park, I was indeed being racist. But I'm going to change. I'm going to strive to be anti-racist."" And to be racist is to constantly deny the racial inequities that pervade American society, to constantly deny the racist ideas that pervade American minds. And so I want to built a just and equitable society, and the only way we're going to even begin that process is if we admit our racism and start building an anti-racist world. Thank you. CS: Thank you so much for that. You know, your book, ""How to Be an Antiracist,"" has become a bestseller in light of what's been happening, and you've been speaking a bit to the ways in which anti-racism and racism are the only two polar opposite ways to hold a view on racism. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about what the basic tenets of anti-racism are, for people who aren't as familiar with it in terms of how they can be anti-racist. IXK: Sure. And so I mentioned in my talk that the heartbeat of racism is denial, and really the heartbeat of anti-racism is confession, is the recognition that to grow up in this society is to literally at some point in our lives probably internalize ideas that are racist, ideas that suggest certain racial groups are better or worse than others, and because we believe in racial hierarchy, because Americans have been systematically taught that black people are more dangerous, that black people are more criminal-like, when we live in a society where black people are 40 percent of the national incarcerated population, that's going to seem normal to people. When we live in a society in a city like Minneapolis where black people are 20 percent of the population but more than 60 percent of the people being subjected to police shootings, it's going to seem normal. And so to be anti-racist is to believe that there's nothing wrong or inferior about black people or any other racial group. There's nothing dangerous about black people or any other racial group. And so when we see these racial disparities all around us, we see them as abnormal, and then we start to figure out, OK, what policies are behind so many black people being killed by police? What policies are behind so many Latinx people being disproportionately infected with COVID? How can I be a part of the struggle to upend those policies and replace them with more antiracist policies? Whitney Pennington Rodgers: And so it sounds like you do make that distinction, then, between not racist and anti-racist. I guess, could you talk a little bit more about that and break that down? What is the difference between the two? IXK: In the most simplest way, a not racist is a racist who is in denial, and an anti-racist is someone who is willing to admit the times in which they are being racist, and who is willing to recognize the inequities and the racial problems of our society, and who is willing to challenge those racial inequities by challenging policy. And so I'm saying this because literally slaveholders, slave traders, imagined that their ideas in our terms were not racist. They would say things like, ""Black people are the cursed descendants of Ham, and they're cursed forever into enslavement."" This isn't, ""I'm not racist."" This is, ""God's law."" They would say things, like, you know, ""Based on science, based on ethnology, based on natural history, black people by nature are predisposed to slavery and servility. This is nature's law. I'm not racist. I'm actually doing what nature said I'm supposed to be doing."" And so this construct of being not racist and denying one's racism goes all the way back to the origins of this country. CS: Yeah. And why do you think it has been so hard for some people now to still accept that neutrality is not enough when it comes to racism? IXK: I think because it takes a lot of work to be anti-racist. You have to be very vulnerable, right? You have to be willing to admit that you were wrong. You have to be willing to admit that if you have more, if you're white, for instance, and you have more, it may not be because you are more. You have to admit that, yeah, you've worked hard potentially, in your life, but you've also had certain advantages which provided you with opportunities that other people did not have. You have to admit those things, and it's very difficult for people to be publicly, and even privately, self-critical. I think it's also the case of, and I should have probably led with this, how people define ""racist."" And so people tend to define ""racist"" as, like, a fixed category, as an identity. This is essential to who a person is. Someone becomes a racist. And so therefore -- And then they also connect a racist with a bad, evil person. They connect a racist with a Ku Klux Klansman or woman. And they're like, ""I'm not in the Ku Klux Klan, I'm not a bad person and I've done good things in my life. I've done good things to people of color. And so therefore I can't be racist. I'm not that. That's not my identity. But that's actually not how we should be defining racist. Racist is a descriptive term. It describes what a person is saying or doing in any given moment, and so when a person in one moment is expressing a racist idea, in that moment they are being racist when they're saying black people are lazy. If in the very next moment they're appreciating the cultures of native people, they're being anti-racist. WPR: And we're going to get to some questions from our community in a moment, but I think when a lot of people hear this idea that you're putting forward, this idea of anti-racism, there's this feeling that this is something that only concerns the white community. And so could you speak a little bit to how the black community and nonwhite, other ethnic minorities can participate in and think about this idea of anti-racism? IXK: Sure. So if white Americans commonly say, ""I'm not racist,"" people of color commonly say, ""I can't be racist, because I'm a person of color."" And then some people of color say they can't be racist because they have no power. And so, first and foremost, what I've tried to do in my work is to push back against this idea that people of color have no power. There's nothing more disempowering to say, or to think, as a person of color, than to say you have no power. People of color have long utilized the most basic power that every human being has, and that's the power to resist policy -- that's the power to resist racist policies, that's the power to resist a racist society. But if you're a person of color, and you believe that people coming here from Honduras and El Salvador are invading this country, you believe that these Latinx immigrants are animals and rapists, then you're certainly not, if you're black or Asian or native, going to be a part of the struggle to defend Latinx immigrants, to recognize that Latinx immigrants have as much to give to this country as any other group of people, you're going to view these people as ""taking away your jobs,"" and so therefore you're going to support racist rhetoric, you're going to support racist policies, and even though that is probably going to be harming you, in other words, it's going to be harming, if you're black, immigrants coming from Haiti and Nigeria, if you're Asian, immigrants coming from India. So I think it's critically important for even people of color to realize they have the power to resist, and when people of color view other people of color as the problem, they're not going to view racism as the problem. And anyone who is not viewing racism as the problem is not being anti-racist. CS: You touched on this a bit in your beginning talk here, but you've talked about how racism is the reason that black communities and communities of color are systematically disadvantaged in America, which has led to so many more deaths from COVID-19 in those communities. And yet the media is often placing the blame on people of color for their vulnerability to illness. So I'm curious, in line with that, what is the relationship between anti-racism and the potential for systemic change? IXK: I think it's a direct relationship, because when you are -- when you believe and have consumed racist ideas, you're not going to even believe change is necessary because you're going to believe that racial inequality is normal. Or, you're not going to believe change is possible. In other words, you're going to believe that the reason why black people are being killed by police at such high rates or the reason why Latinx people are being infected at such high rates is because there's something wrong with them, and nothing can be changed. And so you wouldn't even begin to even see the need for systemic structural change, let alone be a part of the struggle for systemic structural change. And so, to be anti-racist, again, is to recognize that there's only two causes of racial inequity: either there's something wrong with people, or there's something wrong with power and policy. And if you realize that there's nothing wrong with any group of people, and I keep mentioning groups -- I'm not saying individuals. There's certainly black individuals who didn't take coronavirus seriously, which is one of the reasons why they were infected. But there are white people who didn't take coronavirus seriously. No one has ever proven, actually studies have shown that black people were more likely to take the coronavirus seriously than white people. We're not talking about individuals here, and we certainly should not be individualizing groups. We certainly should not be looking at the individual behavior of one Latinx person or one black person, and saying they're representatives of the group. That's a racist idea in and of itself. And so I'm talking about groups, and if you believe that groups are equals, then the only other alternative, the only other explanation to persisting inequity and injustice, is power and policy. And to then spend your time transforming and challenging power and policy is to spend your time being anti-racist. WPR: So we have some questions that are coming in from the audience. First one here is from a community member that asks, ""When we talk about white privilege, we talk also about the privilege not to have the difficult conversations. Do you feel that's starting to change?"" IXK: I hope so, because I think that white Americans, too, need to simultaneously recognize their privileges, the privileges that they have accrued as a result of their whiteness, and the only way in which they're going to be able to do that is by initiating and having these conversations. But then they also should recognize that, yes, they have more, white Americans have more, due to racist policy, but the question I think white Americans should be having, particularly when they're having these conversations among themselves, is, if we had a more equitable society, would we have more? Because what I'm asking is that, you know, white Americans have more because of racism, but there are other groups of people in other Western democracies who have more than white Americans, and then you start to ask the question, why is it that people in other countries have free health care? Why is it that they have paid family leave? Why is it that they have a massive safety net? Why is it that we do not? And one of the major answers to why we do not here have is racism. One of the major answers as to why Donald Trump is President of the United States is racism. And so I'm not really asking white Americans to be altruistic in order to be anti-racist. We're really asking people to have intelligent self-interest. Those four million, I should say five million poor whites in 1860 whose poverty was the direct result of the riches of a few thousand white slaveholding families, in order to challenge slavery, we weren't saying, you know, we need you to be altruistic. No, we actually need you to do what's in your self-interest. Those tens of millions of Americans, white Americans, who have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, we're not asking them to be altruistic. We're asking them to realize that if we had a different type of government with a different set of priorities, then they would be much better off right now. I'm sorry, don't get me started. CS: No, we're grateful to you. Thank you. And in line with that, obviously these protests and this movement have led to some progress: the removal of Confederate monuments, the Minneapolis City Council pledging to dismantle the police department, etc. But what do you view as the greatest priority on a policy level as this fight for justice continues? Are there any ways in which we could learn from other countries? IXK: I don't actually think necessarily there's a singular policy priority. I mean, if someone was to force me to answer, I would probably say two, and that is, high quality free health care for all, and when I say high quality, I'm not just talking about Medicare For All, I'm talking about a simultaneous scenario in which in rural southwest Georgia, where the people are predominantly black and have some of the highest death rates in the country, those counties in southwest Georgia, from COVID, that they would have access to health care as high quality as people do in Atlanta and New York City, and then, simultaneously, that that health care would be free. So many Americans not only of course are dying this year of COVID but also of heart disease and cancer, which are the number one killers before COVID of Americans, and they're disproportionately black. And so I would say that, and then secondarily, I would say reparations. And many Americans claim that they believe in racial equality, they want to bring about racial equality. Many Americans recognize just how critical economic livelihood is for every person in this country, in this economic system. But then many Americans reject or are not supportive of reparations. And so we have a situation in which white Americans are, last I checked, their median wealth is 10 times the median wealth of black Americans, and according to a recent study, by 2053 -- between now, I should say, and 2053, white median wealth is projected to grow, and this was before this current recession, and black median wealth is expected to redline at zero dollars, and that, based on this current recession, that may be pushed up a decade. And so we not only have a racial wealth gap, but we have a racial wealth gap that's growing. And so for those Americans who claim they are committed to racial equality who also recognize the importance of economic livelihood and who also know that wealth is inherited, and the majority of wealth is inherited, and when you think of the inheritance, you're thinking of past, and the past policies that many Americans consider to be racist, whether it's slavery or even redlining, how would we even begin to close this growing racial wealth gap without a massive program like reparations? WPR: Well, sort of connected to this idea of thinking about wealth disparity and wealth inequality in this country, we have a question from community member Dana Perls. She asks, ""How do you suggest liberal white organizations effectively address problems of racism within the work environment, particularly in environments where people remain silent in the face of racism or make token statements without looking internally?"" IXK: Sure. And so I would make a few suggestions. One, for several decades now, every workplace has publicly pledged a commitment to diversity. Typically, they have diversity statements. I would basically rip up those diversity statements and write a new statement, and that's a statement committed to anti-racism. And in that statement you would clearly define what a racist idea is, what an anti-racist idea is, what a racist policy is and what an anti-racist policy is. And you would state as a workplace that you're committed to having a culture of anti-racist ideas and having an institution made up of anti-racist policies. And so then everybody can measure everyone's ideas and the policies of that workplace based on that document. And I think that that could begin the process of transformation. I also think it's critically important for workplaces to not only diversify their staff but diversify their upper administration. And I think that's absolutely critical as well. CS: We have some more questions coming in from the audience. We have one from Melissa Mahoney, who is asking, ""Donald Trump seems to be making supporting Black Lives Matter a partisan issue, for example making fun of Mitt Romney for participating in a peaceful protest. How do we uncouple this to make it nonpartisan?"" IXK: Well, I mean, I think that to say the lives of black people is a Democratic declaration is simultaneously stating that Republicans do not value black life. If that's essentially what Donald Trump is saying, if he's stating that there's a problem with marching for black lives, then what is the solution? The solution is not marching. What's the other alternative? The other alternative is not marching for black lives. The other alternative is not caring when black people die of police violence or COVID. And so to me, the way in which we make this a nonpartisan issue is to strike back or argue back in that way, and obviously Republicans are going to claim they're not saying that, but it's a very simple thing: either you believe black lives matter or you don't, and if you believe black lives matter because you believe in human rights, then you believe in the human right for black people and all people to live and to not have to fear police violence and not have to fear the state and not have to fear that a peaceful protest is going to be broken up because some politician wants to get a campaign op, then you're going to institute policy that shows it. Or, you're not. WPR: So I want to ask a question just about how people can think about anti-racism and how they can actually bring this into their lives. I imagine that a lot of folks, they hear this and they're like, oh, you know, I have to be really thoughtful about how my actions and my words are perceived. What is the perceived intention behind what it is that I'm saying, and that that may feel exhausting, and I think that connects even to this idea of policy. And so I'm curious. There is a huge element of thoughtfulness that comes along with this work of being anti-racist. And what is your reaction and response to those who feel concerned about the mental exhaustion from having to constantly think about how your actions may hurt or harm others? IXK: So I think part of the concern that people have about mental exhaustion is this idea that they don't ever want to make a mistake, and I think to be anti-racist is to make mistakes, and is to recognize when we make a mistake. For us, what's critical is to have those very clear definitions so that we can assess our words, we can assess our deeds, and when we make a mistake, we just own up to it and say, ""You know what, that was a racist idea."" ""You know what, I was supporting a racist policy, but I'm going to change."" The other thing I think is important for us to realize is in many ways we are addicted, and when I say we, individuals and certainly this country, is addicted to racism, and that's one of the reasons why for so many people they're just in denial. People usually deny their addictions. But then, once we realize that we have this addiction, everyone who has been addicted, you know, you talk to friends and family members who are overcoming an addiction to substance abuse, they're not going to say that they're just healed, that they don't have to think about this regularly. You know, someone who is overcoming alcoholism is going to say, ""You know what, this is a day-by-day process, and I take it day by day and moment by moment, and yes, it's difficult to restrain myself from reverting back to what I'm addicted to, but at the same time it's liberating, it's freeing, because I'm no longer having to wallow in that addiction. And so I think, and I'm no longer having to hurt people due to my addiction."" And I think that's critical. We spend too much time thinking about how we feel and less time thinking about how our actions and ideas make others feel. And I think that's one thing that the George Floyd video forced Americans to do was to really see and hear, especially, how someone feels as a result of their racism. CS: We have another question from the audience. This one is asking about, ""Can you speak to the intersectionality between the work of anti-racism, feminism and gay rights? How does the work of anti-racism relate and affect the work of these other human rights issues?"" IXK: Sure. So I define a racist idea as any idea that suggests a racial group is superior or inferior to another racial group in any way. And I use the term racial group as opposed to race because every race is a collection of racialized intersectional groups, and so you have black women and black men and you have black heterosexuals and black queer people, just as you have Latinx women and white women and Asian men, and what's critical for us to understand is there hasn't just been racist ideas that have targeted, let's say, black people. There has been racist ideas that have been developed and have targeted black women, that have targeted black lesbians, that have targeted black transgender women. And oftentimes these racist ideas targeting these intersectional groups are intersecting with other forms of bigotry that is also targeting these groups. To give an example about black women, one of the oldest racist ideas about black women was this idea that they're inferior women or that they're not even women at all, and that they're inferior to white women, who are the pinnacle of womanhood. And that idea has intersected with this sexist idea that suggests that women are weak, that the more weak a person is, a woman is, the more woman she is, and the stronger a woman is, the more masculine she is. These two ideas have intersected to constantly degrade black women as this idea of the strong, black masculine woman who is inferior to the weak, white woman. And so the only way to really understand these constructs of a weak, superfeminine white woman and a strong, hypermasculine black woman is to understand sexist ideas, is to reject sexist ideas, and I'll say very quickly, the same goes for the intersection of racism and homophobia, in which black queer people have been subjected to this idea that they are more hypersexual because there's this idea of queer people as being more hypersexual than heterosexuals. And so black queer people have been tagged as more hypersexual than white queer people and black heterosexuals. And you can't really see that and understand that and reject that if you're not rejecting and understanding and challenging homophobia too. WPR: And to this point of challenging, we have another question from Maryam Mohit in our community, who asks, ""How do you see cancel culture and anti-racism interacting. For example, when someone did something obviously racist in the past and it comes to light?"" How do we respond to that? IXK: Wow. So I think it's very, very complex. I do obviously encourage people to transform themselves, to change, to admit those times in which they were being racist, and so obviously we as a community have to give people that ability to do that. We can't, when someone admits that they were being racist, we can't immediately obviously cancel them. But I also think that there are people who do something so egregious and there are people who are so unwilling to recognize how egregious what they just did is, so in a particular moment, so not just the horrible, vicious act, but then on top of that the refusal to even admit the horrible, vicious act. In that case, I could see how people would literally want to cancel them, and I think that we have to, on the other hand, we have to have some sort of consequence, public consequence, cultural consequence, for people acting in a racist manner, especially in an extremely egregious way. And for many people, they've decided, you know what, I'm just going to cancel folks. And I'm not going to necessarily critique them, but I do think we should try to figure out a way to discern those who are refusing to transform themselves and those who made a mistake and recognized it and truly are committed to transforming themselves. CS: Yeah, I mean, one of the concerns many activists have been expressing is that the energy behind the Black Lives Matter movement has to stay high for anti-racist change to truly take place. I think that applies to what you just said as well. And I guess I'm curious what your opinion is on when the protests start to wane and people's donation-matching campaigns fade into the background, how can we all ensure that this conversation about anti-racism stays central? IXK: Sure. So in ""How to Be an Antiracist,"" in one of the final chapters, is this chapter called ""Failure."" I talked about what I call feelings advocacy, and this is people feeling bad about what's happening, what happened to George Floyd or what happened to Ahmaud Arbery or what happened to Breonna Taylor. They just feel bad about this country and where this country is headed. And so the way they go about feeling better is by coming to a demonstration. The way they go about feeling better is by donating to a particular organization. The way they go about feeling better is reading a book. And so if this is what many Americans are doing, then once they feel better, in other words once the individual feels better through their participation in book clubs or demonstrations or donation campaigns, then nothing is going to change except, what, their own feelings. And so we need to move past our feelings. And this isn't to say that people shouldn't feel bad, but we should use our feelings, how horrible we feel about what is going on, to put into place, put into practice, anti-racist power and policies. In other words, our feelings should be driving us. They shouldn't be the end all. This should not be about making us feel better. This should be about transforming this country, and we need to keep our eyes on transforming this country, because if we don't, then once people feel better after this is all over, then we'll be back to the same situation of being horrified by another video, and then feeling bad, and then the cycle will only continue. WPR: You know, I think when we think about what sort of changes we can implement and how we could make the system work better, make our governments work better, make our police work better, are there models in other countries where -- obviously the history in the United States is really unique in terms of thinking about race and oppression. But when you look to other nations and other cultures, are there other models that you look at as examples that we could potentially implement here? IXK: I mean, there are so many. There are countries in which police officers don't wear weapons. There are countries who have more people than the United States but less prisoners. There are countries who try to fight violent crime not with more police and prisons but with more jobs and more opportunities, because they know and see that the communities with the highest levels of violent crime tend to be communities with high levels of poverty and long-term unemployment. I think that -- And then, obviously, other countries provide pretty sizable social safety nets for people such that people are not committing crimes out of poverty, such that people are not committing crimes out of despair. And so I think that it's critically important for us to first and foremost think through, OK, if there's nothing wrong with the people, then how can we go about reducing police violence? How can we go about reducing racial health inequities? What policies can we change? What policies have worked? These are the types of questions we need to be asking, because there's never really been anything wrong with the people. CS: In your ""Atlantic"" piece called ""Who Gets To Be Afraid in America,"" you wrote, ""What I am, a black male, should not matter. Who I am should matter."" And I feel that's kind of what you're saying, that in other places maybe that's more possible, and I'm curious when you imagine a country in which who you are mattered first, what does that look like? IXK: Well, what it looks like for me as a black American is that people do not view me as dangerous and thereby make my existence dangerous. It allows me to walk around this country and to not believe that people are going to fear me because of the color my skin. It allows me to believe, you know what, I didn't get that job because I could have done better on my interview, not because of the color of my skin. It allows me to -- a country where there's racial equity, a country where there's racial justice, you know, a country where there's shared opportunity, a country where African American culture and Native American culture and the cultures of Mexican Americans and Korean Americans are all valued equally, that no one is being asked to assimilate into white American culture. There's no such thing as standard professional wear. There's no such thing as, well, you need to learn how to speak English in order to be an American. And we would truly not only have equity and justice for all but we would somehow have found a way to appreciate difference, to appreciate all of the human ethnic and cultural difference that exists in the United States. This is what could make this country great, in which we literally become a country where you could literally travel around this country and learn about cultures from all over the world and appreciate those cultures, and understand even your own culture from what other people are doing. There's so much beauty here amid all this pain and I just want to peel away and remove away all of those scabs of racist policies so that people can heal and so that we can see true beauty. WPR: And Ibram, when you think about this moment, where do you see that on the spectrum of progress towards reaching that true beauty? IXK: Well, I think, for me, I always see progress and resistance in demonstrations and know just because people are calling from town squares and from city halls for progressive, systemic change that that change is here, but people are calling and people are calling in small towns, in big cities, and people are calling from places we've heard of and places we need to have heard of. People are calling for change, and people are fed up. I mean, we're living in a time in which we're facing a viral pandemic, a racial pandemic within that viral pandemic of people of color disproportionately being infected and dying, even an economic pandemic with over 40 million Americans having lost their jobs, and certainly this pandemic of police violence, and then people demonstrating against police violence only to suffer police violence at demonstrations. I mean, people see there's a fundamental problem here, and there's a problem that can be solved. There's an America that can be created, and people are calling for this, and that is always the beginning. The beginning is what we're experiencing now. CS: I think that this next audience question follows well from that, which is, ""What gives you hope right now?"" IXK: So certainly resistance to racism has always given me hope, and so even if, let's say, six months ago we were not in a time in which almost every night all over this country people were demonstrating against racism, but I could just look to history when people were resisting. And so resistance always brings me hope, because it is always resistance, and of course it's stormy, but the rainbow is typically on the other side. But I also receive hope philosophically, because I know that in order to bring about change, we have to believe in change. There's just no way a change maker can be cynical. It's impossible. So I know I have to believe in change in order to bring it about. WPR: And we have another question here which addresses some of the things you talked about before in terms of the structural change that we need to bring about. From Maryam Mohit: ""In terms of putting into practice the transformative policies, is then the most important thing to loudly vote the right people into office at every level who can make those structural changes happen?"" IXK: So I think that that is part of it. I certainly think we should vote into office people who, from school boards to the President of the United States, people who are committed to instituting anti-racist policies that lead to equity and justice, and I think that that's critically important, but I don't think that we should think that that's the only thing we should be focused on or the only thing that we should be doing. And there are institutions, there are neighborhoods that need to be transformed, that are to a certain extent outside of the purview of a policymaker who is an elected official. There are administrators and CEOs and presidents who have the power to transform policies within their spheres, within their institutions, and so we should be focused there. The last thing I'll say about voting is, I wrote a series of pieces for ""The Atlantic"" early this year that sought to get Americans thinking about who I call ""the other swing voter,"" and not the traditional swing voter who swings from Republican to Democrat who are primarily older and white. I'm talking about the people who swing from voting Democrat to not voting at all. And these people are typically younger and they're typically people of color, but they're especially young people of color, especially young black and Latinx Americans. And so we should view these people, these young, black and Latino voters who are trying to decide whether to vote as swing voters in the way we view these people who are trying to decide between whether to vote for, let's say, Trump or Biden in the general election. In other words, to view them both as swing voters is to view them both in a way that, OK, we need to persuade these people. They're not political cattle. We're not just going to turn them out. We need to encourage and persuade them, and then we also for these other swing voters need to make it easier for them to vote, and typically these young people of color, it's the hardest for them to vote because of voter suppression policies. CS: Thank you, Ibram. Well, we're going to come to a close of this interview, but I would love to ask you to read something that you wrote a couple of days ago on Instagram. You wrote this beautiful caption on a photo of your daughter, and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share that with us and briefly tell us how we could each take this perspective into our own lives. IXK: Sure, so yeah, I posted a picture of my four-year-old daughter Imani, and in the caption I wrote, ""I love, and because I love, I resist. There have been many theories on what's fueling the growing demonstrations against racism in public and private. Let me offer another one: love. We love. We know the lives of our loved ones, especially our black loved ones, are in danger under the violence of racism. People ask me all the time what fuels me. It is the same: love, love of this little girl, love of all the little and big people who I want to live full lives in the fullness of their humanity, not barred by racist policies, not degraded by racist ideas, not terrorized by racist violence. Let us be anti-racist. Let us defend life. Let us defend our human rights to live and live fully, because we love."" And, you know, Cloe, I just wanted to sort of emphasize that at the heart of being anti-racist is love, is loving one's country, loving one's humanity, loving one's relatives and family and friends, and certainly loving oneself. And I consider love to be a verb. I consider love to be, I'm helping another, and even myself, to constantly grow into a better form of myself, of themselves, that they've expressed who they want to be. And so to love this country and to love humanity is to push humanity constructively to be a better form of itself, and there's no way we're going to be a better form, there's no way we can build a better humanity, while we still have on the shackles of racism. WPR: I think that's so beautiful. I appreciate everything you've shared, Ibram. I feel like it's made it really clear this is not an easy fix. Right? There is no band-aid option here that will make this go away, that this takes work from all of us, and I really appreciate all of the honesty and thoughtfulness that you've brought to this today. IXK: You're welcome. Thank you so much for having this conversation with me. CS: Thank you so much, Ibram. We're really grateful to you for joining us. IXK: Thank you."

Romero",The path to ending systemic racism in the US,Jun 2020,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. It's a big one today, as big as they get. You know, when we created this ""Build Back Better"" series our thought was how could we address issues arising out of the pandemic, how could we imagine building back from that. But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, I mean, they provided a new urgency which we, of course, simply have to address. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we just have to seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris. Right now, so many people in the United States and beyond are grappling with feelings of anger and frustration, deep, deep sadness and really helplessness. No matter who you are, you have questions about what to do now, how to make things better. And as we've seen, violence like this unfolds for many, many years. What is the path forward? CA: So -- We're joined today by a group of activists, organizers and leaders known for their crucial work in social justice and civil rights. We're so grateful to have them here to engage in a discussion about racial injustice in America, the unbearable acts of violence that we've -- Acts of violence against the black community that we've witnessed, the dangers to a nation riven by anger and fear. And how on earth we can move forward from this to something better. So first, each of our four guests will share their thoughts on how we move forward from this moment. And then we'll engage as a group, including you, the TED community. WPR: And we'd like to thank our partner, the Project Management Institute. Their generous support has helped make today's interviews possible, and of course, as Chris mentioned, we want you to take part in the conversation, so please share your questions using our Ask a question feature and continue to share your thoughts in the discussion thread. CA: Thanks, Whitney. OK, let's get this moving. Our first guest. Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff is the founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity. They work with police departments across America, including in Minneapolis, to seek measurable responses to racial bias. Phil, I can scarcely imagine how the stress in the last week must have been for you. Welcome, and over to you for your opening comments. Phillip Atiba Goff: Thanks, Chris. Yeah, this week has been a gut punch to anybody who felt like we could be making progress in the way that we put forward public safety that empowers particularly vulnerable communities. We started working in Minneapolis about five years ago. At the time, it was, like most major cities in the United States, a department that had a long history of unaccounted for violence from law enforcement, targeting the most vulnerable black communities. And we tried to put into place a number of things that we know work. Change the culture, so that the culture can be accountable to the values of the community. And what we saw was small but measurable progress. We always knew, with small and measurable progress, that you're one tragic incident from going back to ground zero. But the events of the last week and a half haven't brought us back to ground zero, they've torched ground zero, and we've dug a hole that we have to dig ourselves out of. What I hear from police chiefs who call me, from activists I talk to, from folks in the communities that are literally on fire right now, I hear folks saying, I had one activist say to me that the pain that he was feeling was too large to fit into his body. And without thinking about it, I said right back, ""That's because it's too large to fit into a lifetime."" What we're seeing isn't just the response to one gruesome, cruel, public execution. A lynching. It's not just the reaction to three of them: Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and then George Floyd. What we're seeing is the bill come due for the unpaid debts that this country owes to its black residents. And it comes due usually every 20 to 30 years. It was Ferguson just six years ago, but about 30 years before that, it was in the streets of Los Angeles, after the verdict that exonerated the police that beat Rodney King on video. It was Newark, it was Watts, it was Chicago, it was Tulsa, it was Chicago again. If we don't take a full accounting of these debts that are owed, then we're going to keep paying it. Part of what I've been experiencing in the last week and a half, and what I've been sharing with the people who do this work, who are serious about it, is the acknowledgment, the soul-crushing reality that at some point, when things stop being on fire, the cameras are going to turn to something else. And the history that we have in this country is not just a history of vicious neglect and a targeted abuse of black communities, it's also one where we lose our attention for it. And what that means for communities like in Baton Rouge, for those who still grieve Alton Sterling, and in Baltimore, for those who are still grieving Freddie Gray, is that there is not just a chance, there's a likelihood that we are a month or two months out from this with no more to show for it than what we had to show after Michael Brown Jr. And holding the weight of that, individually and collectively, is just too much. It's just too heavy a load for a person or a people, or a generation to hold up. What we're seeing is the unrepentant sins, the unpaid debts. And so the solution can't just be that we fix policing. It can't be only incremental reform. It can't be only systems of accountability to catch cops after they've killed somebody. Because there's no such thing as justice for George Floyd. There's maybe accountability. There's maybe some relief from the people who are still around, who loved him, for his daughter who spoke out yesterday and said, ""My Daddy changed the world."" There won't be justice for a man who's dead when he didn't have to be. But we're not going to get to where we need to go just by reforming police. So in addition to the work that CPE is known for with the data, we have been encouraging departments and cities to take the money that should be going to invest in communities, and take it from police budgets, bring it to the communities. People ask, ""Well, what could it possibly look like? How could we imagine it?"" And I tell people, there is a place where we do this in the United States right now. We've all heard about it, whispered, some of us have even been there, some of us live there. The place is called the suburbs, where we already have enough resources to give to people, so they don't need the police for public safety in the first place. If someone has a substance abuse issue, they can go to a clinic. If somebody has a medical issue, they've got insurance, they can go to a hospital. If there's a domestic dispute, they have friends, they have support. You don't need to enter a badge and a gun into it. If we hadn't disinvested from all the public resources that were available in communities that most needed those, we wouldn't need police in the first place, and many have been arguing, even more loudly recently, that we don't. If we would just take the money that we use to punish, and instead invest it in the promise and the genius of the community that could be there. So I don't know all the ways we're going to get there. I know it's going to take everything and. It's going to need the kind of systemic change and the management tools that we traditionally offer. It's also going to need a quantum change in the way that we think about public safety. But mostly, this isn't just a policing problem. This is the unpaid debts that are owed to black America. The bill is coming due. And we need to start getting an accounting together, so we're not just paying off the interest of the damn thing. WPR: Thank you, Phil. Rashad Robinson is the president of Color Of Change, a civil rights organization that advocates for racial justice for the black community. To date, more than four million people have signed their petition to arrest the officers involved in the murder of George Floyd. And of course, one was arrested last week. Thank you so much for being with us, Rashad, welcome. Rashad Robinson: Thank you. And thank you for having me. It's an opportunity that I'm taking today to just tell you about how you can get involved. How you can take action, because right now, strategic action is critical for all of us to do the work to change the rules that far too often keep the systems in place that hold us back. Make no mistake, the criminal justice system is not broken. It is operating exactly the way it was designed. At every single level, the criminal justice system is not about providing justice, but about ensuring that certain people, certain communities are protected, while other communities are violated. And so I wan to talk a little bit today about Color Of Change, about activism, about the work that's happening on the ground from other organizations all around the country, and the way that you can channel this energy. What we talk about at Color Of Change is how do you channel presence into power. Far too often we mistake presence and visibility for power, presence retweets the stories of the movement, people feeling passion about change could sometimes make us feel like change is inevitable, but power is actually the ability to change the rules. And right now, every day, people are taking action, and what we're trying to channel that energy into is a couple of things. First is a whole set of demands at the federal level and at the local level. As Phil described, policing operates on many different channels. And what we need to recognize is that while there are a lot of things that can happen at the federal level, locally all around the country there are decisions that are being made in communities around how policing is executed, where community needs to hold a deeper level of accountability, at the state level we need new laws. So at Color Of Change, we've built a whole platform around a set of demands and are working to build more energy for everyday people to take action. We're fighting for justice for Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, we're also fighting for justice for other folks whose names you haven't heard, Nina Pop and others, whose stories of injustice and the relationship to the criminal justice system represent all the ways in which fighting right now is important. Over the last couple of years, we have worked to build a movement, to hold district attorneys accountable and to change the role of district attorneys in our country. And through the Winning Justice platform at Color Of Change, www.winningjustice.org, what we have worked to do is channel the energy of everyday people to take action. So, for folks who are watching what's happening on TV, seeing it on their social media feeds and are outraged about what's happening in Georgia, what's happening in Tennessee, what's happening in Minnesota, you yourself, probably, most likely, live in a place, in a community where you have a district attorney that will not hold police accountable, that will not prosecute police when they harm, hurt black folks, when they violate the laws, you live in a community where police are part of the structure that is racking up mass incarceration, but many other aspects of our system are racking up mass incarceration, and district attorneys are at the center of it. You live in those communities and you need to do something about it. And so at winningjustice.org, we've created the only searchable, national database on the 2,400 prosecutors around the country. We're building local squads and communities for folks to be able to engage around efforts that hold DAs accountable. We've worked with our partners across the movement, from our friends in Black Lives Matter, to folks who do policy work, to our friends at local ACLU chapters around the country, to build six demands. Six demands that folks can get behind in terms of pushing for reform, and then we've built public education material. But the only way that we work to change the way that prosecution happens in this country is that if people get involved. If people raise their voice, if people join us in pushing for real change. At the end of the day, I want people to recognize though, and Phillip talked a little bit about this, is that people don't experience issues, they experience life. That the forces that hold us back are deeply interrelated, a racist criminal justice system requires a racist media culture to survive, a political inequality follows economic inequality, they all go hand in hand. And so I also want us to not take ourselves out of the equation. We likely work inside of corporations that may post symbols for Black Lives Matter one day, and then support politicians that work to destroy Black Lives Matter the next day. We oftentimes are engaged in practices inside of our companies or in our daily lives supporting media properties and others that are harming our communities, are telling stories. Recently, we produced a report at Color Of Change with the Norman Lear school at USC. It's called ""Normalizing Injustice,"" and it can be found at changehollywood.org. And ""Normalizing Injustice"" looks at the 22 crime procedurals, those crime shows on TV. And looks at all of the ways in which they, sort of, create a warped perception about our view of justice. They create sort of an incentive for the type of policing we see on the country, and actually serve as a PR arm for law enforcement. We've been working in writers rooms around the country to work to push folks to tell better stories, but we need folks to be both active listeners, and we need folks in the industry to push back and challenge those, not only the structures that lead to that content coming on the air, but the proliferation across our airwaves. At the end of the day, we have an opportunity in this moment to make change. Inflection points are those moments where we have an opportunity to make huge leaps forward, or the real, real threat of falling backwards. In our hands is the ability to do some incredible things about undoing so many of the injustices that have stood in the way of progress for far too long. But everyday people must get involved. We must channel that presence into power, and we must build the type of power that changes the rules. Racism in so many ways is like water pouring over a floor with holes in it. Every single -- In every single way, it will find the holes. And so for us, we cannot simply accept charitable solutions to structural problems, but we actually have to work for structural change. And so I want to end by saying one thing about how we talk about black people and how we talk about black communities in this moment. Because we have to say what we mean, and we have to build the narrative that gets us to where we want to go. So far too often, we talk about black communities as vulnerable, we talk about black people as vulnerable, but vulnerability is a personal trait, black communities have been under attack. Black communities have been exploited, black communities have been targeted, and we need to say that, so we don't put the onus on fixing black families and communities, but we put the onus on fixing the structures that have harmed us. We will say things like, ""Black people are less likely to get loans from banks,"" instead of saying that banks are less likely to give loans to black people. This is our opportunity to build the type of progress that makes real change, and at the center of this story, we need to show and elevate the images not just of the pain that we are facing, but of the joy, the brilliance and the creativity that black people have brought to this country. Black people are the protagonist of this story, and we need to make sure that as we work to build a new tomorrow, we ensure that the heroes are at the center of the liberation that we all need. Thank you. CA: Thank you, Rashad. Dr. Bernice King is the CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The center is a living memorial to her father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's dedicated to inspiring new generations to carry his work forward. In this moment, when so many are hurting, how can we better approach unity and collective healing? Dr. King, over to you. Bernice King: My heart is a little heavy right now, because I was that six-year-old. I was five years old when my father was assassinated. And he did change the world. But the tragedy is that we didn't hear what he was saying to us as a prophet to this nation. And his words are now reverberating back to us. Change, we all know, is necessary right now. And yet, it's not easy. We know that there has to be changes in policing in this nation of ours. But I want to talk about America's choice at a greater level. The prophet said to us, ""We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence, or violent coannihilation."" What we have witnessed over the last eight days has placed that choice before us. We have seen literally in the streets of our nation people who have been following the path of nonviolent protest, and people who have been hell-bent on destruction. Those choices are now looking at us, and we have to make a choice. The history of this nation was founded in violence. In fact, my father said America is the greatest purveyor of violence. And the only way forward is if we repent for being a nation built on violence. And I'm not just talking about physical violence. I'm talking about systemic violence, I'm talking about policy violence, I'm talking about what he spoke of are the triple evils of poverty, racism and militarism. All violent. Albert Einstein said something to us. He said we cannot solve problems on the same level of thinking in which they were created. And so if we are going to move forward, we are going to have to deconstruct these systems of violence that we have set in America. And we're going to have to reconstruct on another foundation. That foundation happens to be love and nonviolence. And so, as we move forward, we can correct course if we make that choice that Daddy said, nonviolent coexistence. And not continue on the pathway of violent coannihilation. So what does that look like? That looks like some deconstruction work in order to get to the construction. We have to deconstruct our thinking. We've got to deconstruct the way in which we see people and deconstruct the way in which we operate, practice and engage and set policy. And so I believe that there's a lot of heart, h-e-a-r-t work to do, in the midst of all the h-a-r-d, hard work to do. Because heart work is hard work. One of the things we have to do is we have to ensure that everyone, especially my white brothers and sisters, have to engage in the heart work, the antiracism work, in our hearts. No one is exempt from this, especially in my white community. We must do that work in our hearts, the antiracism work. The second thing is that I encourage people to look at the nonviolence training that we [have] at the King Center, thekingcenter.org, so that we learn the foundation of understanding our interrelatedness and interconnectedness. That we understand our loyalties and our commitments and our policy-making can no longer be devoted to one group of people, but has to be devoted to the greater good of all people. And so I'm inviting people to even join us on our own line of protest that's happening every night at seven o'clock pm on the King Center Facebook page, because so many people have things that they want to express and contribute to this. We all have to change and have to make a choice. It is a choice to change the direction that we have been going. We need a revolution of values in this country. That's what my Daddy said. He changed the world, he changed hearts, and now, what has happened over the last seven, eight years and through history, we have to change course. And we all have to participate in changing America with the true revolution of values, where people are at the center, and not profit. Where morality is at the center, and not our military might. America does have a choice. We can either choose to go down continually that path of destruction, or we can choose nonviolent coexistence. And as my mother said, struggle is a never-ending process, freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every generation. Every generation is called to this freedom struggle. You as a person may want to exempt yourself, but every generation is called. And so I encourage corporations in America to start doing antiracism work within corporate America. I encourage every industry to start doing antiracism work, and pick up the banner of understanding nonviolent change, personally, and from a social change perspective. We can do this. We can make the right choice to ultimately build the beloved community. Thank you. WPR: Thank you, Dr. King. Anthony Romero is the executive director of American Civil Liberties Union. As one of the nation's oldest social justice organizations, the ACLU has advocated for racial equality and shown deep support to the black community in moments of crisis. And in moments like these, black voices are almost always the loudest and at times the silence from our nonblack brothers and sisters can feel deafening. How we can bring our allies into the mix, to better support ending systemic violence and racism against the black communities, is a question top of mind for a lot of us. Anthony, welcome to the show, and thank you so much for being with us. Anthony Romero: Great. Thank you, thank you Whitney, thank you, Chris, for inviting me to join this TED community. I think community is really important right now. With so many of us feeling trepidation, the weariness, the anger, the fear, the frustration, the terrorism that we've experienced in our communities. This is a time to huddle around a virtual campfire, with your posse, with your family, with your loved ones, with your network. It's not a time to be isolated or alone. And I think for allies in this struggle, those of us who don't live this experience every day, it is time for us to lean in. You can't change the channel, you can't tune out, you can't say, ""This is too hard."" It is not that hard for us to listen and learn and heed. It is the only way we're going to build out of this, by hearing the voices of Rashad, and Phil and Dr. King. By hearing the voices of our neighbors and loved ones, by hearing the voices on Twitter of people who we don't know. And so white communities and allied organizations need to pay even closer attention. This is the test of your character. How willing are you to lean in and to engage. For me, I have -- These have been really hard couple of weeks. I feel like this is really a test of whether or not we really believe in the American experiment. Do we really believe it? Do we really believe that out of many, one, a country with no unifying language, no unifying culture, no unifying religion, can we really become one people? All equal before the law? All bound together with a belief in the rule of law? Do we really believe that or do we just think it's a nice saying to see on the back of a paper dollar? And for me, this is a referendum on the American experiment. On whether we really believe, and ... the future is in our hands. And this is not like other crises, I've been the head of the ACLU for almost 20 years, I feel like I've seen it all. This is different. And this is different because it is cumulative, like Phil and Rashad and Dr. King told us, this is centuries of systemic discrimination, and the bill has come due. And it will continue to be due, and we will pay. Unless we really do something quite different. I have been scratching my head at the ACLU for the last week. We've been at this for 100 years. My organization has been working on this from its inception. In 1931, we were involved with this report about lawlessness in law enforcement. That was our first report that we got behind in 1931. We opened up our first door fronts after the riots in Watts, so that we can bring legal services and lawyers to the communities so they could demand justice from the police departments. You know, we brought Miranda, you know, the right to remain silent, and we brought Gideon, the right to a court-appointed attorney if you can't afford one. We fought Bloomberg on ""stop-and-frisk,"" it took him years and he lost in front of our litigation to finally apologize. We've been at this for 100 years. And for the communities that have lived this for 400 years, God. I've been scratching my head, thinking. It ain't working. We don't need another pattern and practice lawsuit. We don't need another training program on racial bias or implicit bias in police departments, we don't need to file another lawsuit on qualified immunity, we don't need to, kind of, bring another race discrimination or gender discrimination lawsuit to integrate the police department. Yeah, we've done that and we will continue to do that. For me, where I've come, is that we need to defund the budgets of these police departments. It's the only way we're going to take the power back. And the more I read over the last couple of weeks about where this country is, the more I'm clear that that is my North star at the moment. We will continue to bring the litigation on qualified immunity, we will do the efforts to hold unaccountable law enforcement officials accountable, we will bring pattern and practice lawsuits, because the justice department is not doing that, so we will continue to do all that good work. But the real thing is, we're going to go after those budgets. When you look at the fact that we spend 100 million dollars on policing, more than incarceration, that the city of Minneapolis spent 30 percent of their budget on policing. The city of Oakland, 41 percent on policing. That when you have New York City police department spend more money on policing than it does on housing and preservation development, community youth services, homelessness. We're going after the money. And that's hard-core advocacy. Bills drop in local legislatures to cut the funding for police, to stop these programs that give the federal military surplus to police departments, so they become, like, little mini armies, these don't look like police officers, these look like standing armies. And the enemy are communities of color. So we need to take away their toys. We need to cut their budgets. We need to shrink the police infrastructure, so that we can get police out of the quotidian lives of people of color and communities of color. The ubiquitousness of police enforcement on things that the police do not have a role, should not have a role to play. People should not lose their lives over whether or not a cigarette pack has a proper tax stamp, or whether a 20-dollar bill was forged or not. That's not worthy of spending our dollars on police. Get them out of that business, let's focus on the most important and the most serious of crimes, and that's it. That's it. We're going to depolice our communities. Shrink those budgets. We're going to reinvest those moneys in local communities, it will be like water on stone campaigns, local legislatures, local city counsels, lab report cards, for people who talk out of both sides of their mouths and say, ""We believe in police reform,"" and yet, they're still going to vote for 30 or 40 percent for the police? We're going to put that right to the public. And I think we just have to stay at it, because I think that's the only way we can get at this in a different way. Because much of what we tried to do is just simply not working. You know, with that, I struggle with, how do you find the optimism in this moment, because you have to find the optimism. You have to find the way to still think that even though on the face of so many setbacks, there's been change. It's been too little, too slow, not enough. We need to kind of, rock it, boost it. But you can't lose sight of the optimism. And you know, I've been thinking about who are the folks inspiring me, and Dr. King's father, of course, and the words of Rashad and Patrisse Cullors and others have inspired me. But I find inspiration in the words of a scholar I really don't like bringing up, Sam Huntington, kind of often criticized as being a conservative, a racist. But sometimes you can find inspiration even in your enemy's words. And in one of his books, which I pulled off the shelf I have, he writes about how America is a disappointment, because it failed to live up to its aspirations. And he actually started talking about, America is a failure because it doesn't live up to its ideals. But it's not a failure, it's not a bunch of lies. It's a disappointment. And in the disappointment also is the fact that there's hope. I'm paraphrasing it, but I think we have to kind of, wrap all of that together, and think about the disappointment and the hope and the resolve to do better. And we need to listen and lean in, and I thank the TED community, I thank Dr. King, I thank Rashad, I thank Phil. Thank you. CA: Wow. Thank you to all four of you, that was astonishing. I guess we're bringing everyone back now to have a conversation among us, to answer questions from our community, I hope you're entering those questions. So I don't know whether we can bring back our guests onto the screen at this point. Welcome back. Let me start with a question to you, Dr. King, I was so inspired by what you said. Your father, of course, also deeply understood the anger that leads to protest. I think he said that protests are the language of the unheard. And I'm wondering what you would say to someone right now who is angered beyond measure by what's happened, and also sees this could be the moment, you know, like, someone who believes the system is so fundamentally broken, that our best choice is to tear it down, that that is actually -- This may be a once-in-a-generation moment to do that. And so to actually believe that protest, including violent protest, actually is the way right now. What would you say to someone who felt that? BK: First, I just wanted to make just a slight correction, he said riots are the language of the unheard. CA: I apologize, I apologize. But that is the point even more powerfully, yeah. BK: Yes. Protest we must, and we must continue to always protest, to keep the issues in the awareness before people, but you know, when a person is angry, sometimes it's hard to reach them. I've been on that journey, I was at a stage of my life where I was so angry, I wanted to destroy, and I'm the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., and grew up in a household of love and nonviolence and forgiveness, and I had to go through that journey I was surrounded by the right kind of influences, fortunately. Because that would have been a sad story. But I think it's really allowing ourselves to hear the anger and allowing the space for the anger, but also trying to help young people rechannel that energy. And we've got to start ensuring that we connect them to some of the work that has been and now is elevated to another place. Color Of Change, the work that you're doing, the ACLU, the work that they're doing, because sometimes, there's this disconnection that intensifies the emotion and makes you feel helpless. But if you can channel that anger, connect it with action that is toward creating the social and economic change, then it begins to build you up, and then you can begin to become more constructive with the anger. WPR: We have some questions that are coming in from our community, but before we do that, you all shared such powerful, meaningful statements right now, and many of you touched on the fact that this is not the first time that we're experiencing this. The murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, this is one of -- these are three of many, many instances just like this, and I'd love to hear you all address was has, sort of, brought us to this boiling point, what has contributed to this moment where we're now experiencing things, Anthony, as you said, that feels so much worse than other moments? And that's it, anyone who feels comfortable to take that question. AR: Rashad, I want to hear you. BK: I wanted to say something. I think we've always been at that moment. But this moment is different, because of the void in leadership. There's no real moral voice in our country, and the person who sits in the office of the presidency is not, you know, leading in the right way. And has kind of -- no, not kind of, has given license to certain things. And so now it's, you know, he's lit the fires. WPR: Yeah. RR: The thing I'll add ... The thing I'll add here is, you know, a couple of things. For the last couple of months, we have been both seeing and experiencing all of the ways that this country's decisions of underinvestment, of targeting black communities, has been killing black people through COVID. And while we've been in our homes, we have also been watching how the media has blamed us as we have been the essential workers in so many places and trying to ensure that this country keeps going. We've watched white men with guns show up to capitols demanding, basically, black and brown people go back to work. And then we see this eight-minute video with a police officer, with his knee on someone's neck, after seeing that video of Ahmaud Arbery and hearing the story of Breonna Taylor, and we see him looking in the camera, basically knowing that America was not going to punish him. And what I think it is is that it's just enough is enough, that people didn't feel that they had a channel for that outrage, and because people had been inside, and because people had been experiencing all the ways in which the structures had also been colluding to kill us, that what we're seeing is alignment of all of those things, where people are making demands that are much bigger and much bolder than before. And we recognize that while we don't have leadership at the federal level, we also have to recognize that no political party can say that they have been 100 percent, neither political party can say they've been 100 percent on the right side of all these issues. And so people are mobilizing, they are fighting back like never before, and in some ways, people are unwilling to accept answers like, ""Just go vote,"" or, ""Just participate in the process,"" because we recognize that black people have been voting, black people have been part of voting, and part of ensuring that. And so that I think is why this moment feels so much different, combined with, for the last seven years, since Trayvon, we have seen the growth of a new movement of activists and leaders all around the country, who are also in a very different place to be able to move the needle on so much of what's possible. CA: We have a question here from Genesis Be. If we can get that up here. ""Here in Mississippi, the police is synonymous with the Klan, historically. How do we purge law enforcement of white supremacists?"" PAG: So I guess that's partially to me, being the psychologist of bias. I'll say that just yesterday we had an officer in Denver who posted on social media himself and two other officers saying, ""Let's go start a riot."" He was fired that day. I worry about all the officers that the FBI has now, for almost half a decade, been warning us, law enforcement and unions being infiltrated by white supremacists. And all the officers that have social media accounts, but they're private. You know, the Invisible Institute has put some things forward. We're not talking seriously about the domestic terrorism threat that white supremacy represents. So the first thing that we've got to do is we've got to take it seriously. We have to actually say out loud, and I can't believe that on a day like today, or a week like this week, I have to say out loud, white supremacy is alive and well and a driving force of American politics. This shouldn't be controversial. I shouldn't be looking forward to getting hate mail in my inbox for it, but that's the reality. So the first part of solving a problem is acknowledging that it exists. But the second thing is we need to arm municipalities, that's law enforcement, but even more so communities, with the ability to take action when someone violates their values. Right now, I think about the case in Philadelphia where Charles Ramsey, when he was a commissioner there, fired six officers, right. Concerns about racial bias and concerns about police brutality, and those six officers were back on the same job inside of three months. We now have a law enforcement system that says you can lose your job in one jurisdiction, and get the same job as law enforcement in another jurisdiction. And without the national registry and the capacity for law enforcement to make different decisions, we're going to have this exact problem, not just in Mississippi, but in Minneapolis, and Louisville and New York and LA. CA: Phil, how much of the problem stems from the fact that police unions have a huge amount of power to protect and sometimes reinstate so called bad apple officers? PAG: Yeah, I'm getting this question a lot, and police unions are one of the most labor forces of the United States, and are unique within the labor movement, right? So it's police unions and teachers' unions are the two largest and could not be two different groups of folks. When I talk to union leadership, that's the leadership what wants to talk to Dr. Blackenstein, right, when I talk to union leadership, what they say is no one hates a bad officer more than a good officer. But the union contracts, the new negotiations, don't look like that's true. What they look like is anybody gets in trouble, and the union's only job is to make sure whatever officer is in trouble, gets to maintain their job. The perverse incentive here is that when people run for union leadership, no one can run saying, ""These people shouldn't be in the union."" It's very hard to do that. What you can run on is say, ""If this person didn't protect you enough, I'll protect you even more. The bigots? I'll protect even them."" So we have this perverse incentive where union leadership ends up not really representing the values even of the rest of the union members. But they have massive, outsized negotiating power. So yes, engaging with and appropriate rightsizing of labor protections, for folks whose jobs are difficult, but who should not be protected from the basic values of human rights, human dignity and public safety. It's got to be part of the process. I mean, when unions are negotiating a two-year ban on keeping of records, so that there's no ability even to trace what's happening in the state of California, historically in terms of police misconduct, that's not in the interest of public safety, public legitimacy, or our democracy. AR: Yeah, the thing I would add, Chris, is that I think the labor union piece is a critically important one to think through. Because I think, like Phil said, they are a key part of the puzzle that we have to solve for. And you know, it's frustrating when you look at a place in Minneapolis, and Phil knows better than I, but when mayor Jacob Frey, the one who's on TV all the time, saying many of the right things that you want an elected official to say at times like this, when he banned his police department from attending the ""warrior training"" that was being offered, it was the Minneapolis Police Federation, local union that defied him and sent their police to the training. And so we need to really be clear that we need to have the police forces under civilian control. I know this sounds so elementary, I feel like I'm talking about a Latin American, kind of, totalitarian context, but we need to exert civilian control of our police in a way that we have yet not been able to think through, and a key part of that is the labor unions of the police. And there are moments when you can find common ground. When we brought one of our COVID-related lawsuits to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic in a Maryland jail, we worked really hard, I worked the phones with the head of police unions. We got one of the local unions to serve as plaintiff in our lawsuit. Because we understood that the incarcerated folks who were being denied access to masks, social distancing and the conditions and lack of testing, and lack of PP, that the people who were also going to be in harm's way were going to be the guards as well. And they were going to be the vectors, communicating the disease out into the community. So if you can find ways of bringing that relationship. But make no mistake, when you go after their budgets, and you start taking away kind of, their munitions, and their seat at the budgeting table, oh, are you going to have a battle on your hands, right? And we have to think about also as we shrink the budgets for police, how do we -- we deploy people in the police departments to other meaningful jobs, right? Because you can't just throw them out into the street, and say, ""You're on your own, you're homeless, good luck to you."" That's not a way to deal with redemption. So we have to really think about all these pieces in a much more cohesive way. WPR: We have another question here from the audience. From Paul Rucker: ""The end of summer of 1919 was followed by the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Johnson-Reed Anti-Immigration Act of 1924, and also the rise of the KKK. Is there a possibility that white supremacy will get stronger if we don't seize this opportunity?"" Rashad, I think this might be something that would be great to hear your perspective on, working so deeply in activism. RR: I'm having a little trouble hearing. WPR: Oh, I'm so sorry. RR: No, it's OK. CA: Can you read the question on the screen, Rashad? RR: Oh, I heard that, I heard you. WPR: Yes, I think it might just be my mic is having some issues here. ""Is there a possibility that white supremacy will get stronger if we don't seize this opportunity."" Yes, absolutely yes. You know, to be clear, right, if we don't have the right diagnosis of white supremacy, if we think of white supremacy as just hoods, if we think of white supremacy as just folks who are operating, you know, with, you know -- in some of these underground networks that have grown, if we're just thinking about white supremacy and white nationalism as people who marched with tiki torches in Charlottesville, then we will really mistake all the ways in which our systems and structures have white supremacy embedded, and allow for something like a Tulsa Race Massacre to happen, something like anti-immigration to happen, but on a day-to-day basis allow for the targeting of black communities through predatory practices by banks. The targeting of black communities through predatory practices like bail. A whole set of systems that can be produced day in and day out. We live in a country where the rules are far too often designed in ways that create a caste system, that create a different standard for some over others, and so when I talked about the inflection point, right, of this moment where something could really go forward and something could turn backwards, we are seeing this right now with this current president. And as we look at what could be happening with the next election, we have to be very, very clear that Donald Trump doesn't just operate on his own. He's enabled by big corporations who benefit from him being in office, and so continue to turn a blind eye to all the things that he does. They may post ""Black Lives Matter,"" but they show up to the White House and engage with Donald Trump. And then we have a whole set of politicians that may sometimes say that he said something that was wrong, but then allow for -- but support his platform in other ways. You know, true co-conspiracy in the effort to dismantle white supremacy and white nationalism is not a thing that people can do on vacation. It is a 365-day project of us constantly working to dismantle all of the structures that have been put in harm's way. The final thing I will just add, because someone mentioned about police unions, and I want to just add that one of the problems with police unions, and many of us have been in this position, I think, is that I have shown up to the table with police unions on many occasions. I remember going to the White House during the last administration and being around a table as we were talking about policing and police reform. And having members of the Fraternal Order of Police leadership say things like, ""All of this talk of racial profiling is new to us."" It is one thing for folks to not agree with you on the policy reforms necessary. It is another thing for people to say that our demands are too aspirational. It's another thing to be gaslit and told the problem doesn't actually exist at all. And that is what we are dealing with, and so we have to actually change the way that people see these institutions. Politicians who say that they are on the side of justice and reform, can no longer take money from police-only unions and Fraternal Order of Police. We actually have to create a new standard, a new litmus test of what does it mean to actually be with us. You can't just sing our songs, use our hashtags and march in our marches, if you are on the other end of supporting the structures that put us in harm's way, that literally kill us. And this is the opportunity for white allies to actually stand up in new ways. To be the type of ally, to do the type of allyship and the type of work that truly dismantles structures, not just provides charity. PAG: And I've got to add to that -- so, Paul, thank you for the question, but we're in a moment where people are looking at what's happening on the street, as if a week and a half ago we weren't in a midst of a global pandemic as the greatest news story, the biggest new story going on. One of the things I'm most worried about, and have been worried about since the beginning, what I've been talking to our chiefs about, is say, you must be out of the social distancing policing game. You can't be the ones doing that, and the reason is this: We're in a moment where creating scapegoats and enemies and others is incredibly politically advantageous for at least one side. And there is deliberate efforts to do exactly that. And we've seen that black communities are two and three and four times more likely to contract this virus, which feels like the manifestation of racial discrimination, because it is. But very soon, that's going to look like black people made bad choices and they need to stay away from us. And when that happens, that's when law enforcements get used to regulate where black movement can be. We used to call it sundown towns, I don't know what we're going to call it when it's around COVID. But it's coming. I'm already seeing that on communities like Nextdoor, and on Facebook groups. People who don't think of themselves as white supremacists but just want the disease away, and the disease has a black and brown face. So we're not only dealing with a moment of generational tension, between black communities and law enforcement, we're dealing with a moment when people are looking for scapegoats, and black people's vulnerability has always been our greatest casting note for being cast as scapegoats. So for folks who are worried about this, this is not inevitably a moment for change and reform and enlightenment and America's best values, because historically, these have been precisely the moments when regression back to white supremacy has reigned supreme. So let's not just look at everybody signaling. I don't want to just see black and white cops on their knees, I want to see the policies. I want to see the things that will prevent this kind of thing from moving to the next stage. CA: Rashad, I want to respect the fact that you've got a hard stop at one. And so I just want to thank you for your participation in this. If you've got a couple of final words you want to share, that would be great, and then if it's OK for the other three, I think there's just a couple other questions I'd love to put and continue this conversation for just a moment longer, if possible. Rashad, any closing words? RR: The thing I want to say is that now is the time for action. And I want to invite people in to join us at Color Of Change to make justice real. And in so many ways, you can visit us at Color Of Change, you can take action. Five, 10, 15 years from now, we will be dealing with the impacts of what we did or didn't do in this moment. How we stood up and how hard we were willing to fight. And as the other speakers have said, now is not the time for reform around the edges, now is time for dismantling the policies and practices that have held us back, and championing solutions and new rules that will move us forward. And so we hope that you will do something, whether it's with us, or whether it's with local organizations in your community, or other groups around the country. But this is an opportunity to make change, and I believe that we can make justice real, if we find the passion and the energy to work together to achieve it. So thank you all for having me, and I hope that we have an opportunity to build, not just online, but offline, in the months to come. CA: Thanks so much, Rashad. We're just going to ask this last question of you. This one is from David Fenton. ""How can the movement unite around a clear, simple platform of policies to enshrine in legislation? Like making all complaints against cops public, banning all choke holds, ensuring independent review boards, etc.?"" WPR: That seems like a great place for you to chime in, Dr. King, if you have some thoughts on that. PAG: I think that was to go to you, Dr. King. BK: Oh, OK. You know, this may sound simplistic, but it's a Nike thing, I think we have to just do it, we have to see our work as interconnected. I think there's been efforts towards people working in that vein, but we have to intensify that. And in doing it, one of the things that my father said, and I know people sometimes get tired of hearing me say, ""My father said,"" but I just think, I wish, should I say, we had really listened to him, because we wouldn't be on this platform right now having this type of conversation. But he left something with us, sort of a blueprint in ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"", his book, and he said, going forward, the meddlesome task is to organize our strength into compelling power. And that is so key, because oftentimes we organize merely around passion. But people have certain areas of strength and talent and giftedness, and we've got to figure out how to build our coalitions based on these strengths. You know, people do different things well. And so, in order to unite in an effective way that they might not elude the demand that we're making, I think that's what's going to happen. People have to do their own personal assessment within their organization, I call it a SWAT analysis. And then that SWAT analysis has to happen across organizations, so that we can make sure that we are moving in a united manner, off of the strengths that each organization brings, so that we can maximize the impact and the effectiveness to do things like this, in terms of getting the legislation in place that is needed in this hour. CA: Thanks so much. Just quick closing words from you, Anthony, and then from you, Phil. Anthony. AR: You know, I would just say that what gives me hope are the young folk. You have to believe that among this group, this groups of young'uns, seeing what they're seeing, living with this president, with these instincts, seeing the continued indifference that mainstream communities have given to issues of racial justice, or economic justice, you've got to believe that what comes out of this very hot fire, is something even more powerful and strong than we've ever seen before. That's what gets me through the hard days that we're now experiencing, this thinking, there is another Dr. King among the young'uns, Dr. King. And I have to believe that what they're seeing and what they're witnessing and their righteous indignation and their frustration and their anger is going to be miraculously a beautiful blossoming of a new opportunity, of a new change. This generation will take us there, I have to believe that. My generation has failed them miserably. So I'm just looking forward to the new ones. CA: Thank you, Anthony. WPR: Phil. Thank you, Anthony. PAG: So it really has been a privilege to be on with you all. To David's question, let me say that a number of civil rights organizations, I believe the ACLU among them, CPE, Center for Policing Equity, and hundreds more have signed on to principles for legislation that would include eight pillars. It's been led by the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights. And it includes a federal ban on choke holds, it includes a national registry for officers who have engaged in misconduct. I also think that it's important at this moment to get, we've got law enforcement's chiefs of major cities willing to say, if we emerge from this moment and our profession hasn't changed, then we have failed again. So it's a critical time to get behind, I would direct you to LCCHR's website for the eight pillars, because I won't remember them all right now, and to start calling your local law enforcement, and say, ""Yes, own that."" You should be signing on, they should be going public with letters that do all of that. But I'll also say this. For a path forward in the principles, I'll end where I started, which is that this is bigger than policing. These are the unpaid debts owed to black communities for stolen labor, owed to native communities for stolen land, for stolen culture, for years taken away and for lives lost in it. This is bigger than policing. If we don't understand the size of it, then there's no solution that's really, truly proportional to the moment. But in this moment, when we're seeing trillion of dollars in bailouts, mostly for corporations, it is absolutely a time when we can do things that normally, people could pretend that's too much, it's too big, we can't. We have literally all the money in the world that can be spent and directed towards making us the society we pretend to be, before moments like this happen. And so the thing that gives me hope is that the lies have to be obvious now. The lies have to be, that was a reasonable use of force. The lie has to be,  we don't have the money. The lie has to be, that's too hard, it's too big of a challenge. This stuff feels impossible every day except today, because the alternative is we lose everything. Everything is at stake, our democracy is at stake, the people we choose to be, we claim to be, that's at stake. And in the face of that, I think we can do impossible things. I think we can be mighty. So my hope for all of us is first, that we wake up tomorrow with more peace in the evening than war, and that we hold on to what's possible from this moment at the same time that we hold on to the size of the task in front of us. I don't want to come with half measures out of this. I don't want to come out with radicalized youth and indifferent aged ... I don't know what the contrast... The radicalized youth and indifferent people who are old like me. I want to come out with a unified country that understands that the costs that we owe are big, and our pockets are deep enough to match it. CA: Wow. Thank you to each of you for extraordinary eloquence. Really, so powerful. This conversation, obviously, continues, I know that there's many people listening, you have other questions, this, I think, from TED's point of view is just the start of the conversation. To the extent that our job is to amplify the voices that matter, we couldn't be prouder to be amplifying further your extraordinary voices. So thank you for being part of this today. PAG: Thank you. WPR: Thank you all."
17:38,Robin Steinberg and Manoush Zomorodi,The US is addicted to incarceration. Here's how to break the cycle,May 2020,"Manoush Zomorodi: So, Robin Steinberg, thank you so much for being my first official guest as the new host of TED Radio Hour. I'm pretty psyched about that. Robin Steinberg: I'm delighted. (Applause) MZ: So OK, I want to start with the Bail Project, how it came to be, how you came up with the idea. The story goes that 10 years ago, you and your husband were eating Chinese takeout food when you came up with the concept. You'd been a public defender for over 30 years, but there was this moment where you decided something had to change. RS: So we had both spent decades in the trenches of the criminal legal system as public defenders, fighting for each and every client the best we could, defending people's humanity and their dignity and fighting for their freedom. And no matter how good we were as lawyers, and I like to think we were really good, and how forceful we fought on behalf of a client, sometimes it all came down to a few hundred dollars. And that was whether or not your client could pay bail and fight her case from freedom or whether she was going to be locked in jail on Rikers Island and desperate would wind up pleading guilty, whether she did it or not. And that just enraged us. And sometimes, you know, the answers are simple and they're right in front of you. And so we thought, ""Well, what if we just paid clients' bail?"" And that's where the idea of creating a revolving bail fund -- because bail comes back at the end of a case, if we could raise money and put it in a fund, and have a revolving fund, we could just pay bail for our clients. Now I have to say, that was back in 2005. People weren’t talking about criminal justice reform the way they are now, there wasn't a lot of conversation about bail reform, and quite honestly, we spent two years knocking on people's door. Nobody answered. Until one day, one man and his family, Jason Flom and his family, decided to take a chance on us and gave us a grant in 2007. And we began to test the revolving bail fund model. And to see what would happen. MZ: Can you clarify, though, like, why it is so important for someone not to be in jail while they await trial? You've explained this in the past and it really blew my mind, because I had no idea what could happen in those days or weeks before someone actually has to plead their case. RS: Sure. So, being held in jail even for a few days can change the trajectory of your life. It is not only the place where you can be victimized, sexually, you can be exposed to violence, you'll be traumatized in all sorts of ways while you're in the jail, and that's even the first few days or a week is when most jail deaths actually, whether they're suicides or homicides, actually happen. But while you're sitting in jail, and understand, folks sitting in jail pretrial have not been convicted of a crime. They're there because they don't have enough money to pay bail. And while that's happening, people's lives are falling apart outside. You're losing your job, you might be losing your home, your children might be taken from you, your immigration status might be jeopardized, you might get thrown out of school. So it's the damage to you that's happening in our local jails, but it's also what's happening to you and your family and your community that you've been removed from while you're waiting for your trial, which, by the way, can take days, weeks and no exaggeration, can take years. MZ: So you explained this sort of crazy limbo that people are in from the TED stage in 2018, and I want to just play a quick clip from that talk that you gave, which was incredibly moving. Can we play that? (Audio: Robin Steinberg TED2018) It's time to do something big. It's time to do something bold. It's time to do something ... maybe audacious? (Laughter) We want to take our proven revolving bail-fund model that we built in the Bronx and spread it across America, attacking the front-end of the legal system before incarceration begins. (Applause) MZ: The energy in the room when you gave your talk was palpable, and it ended up getting you quite a bit of funding from the Audacious Project, which is TED's initiative to get some of these big ideas support to make them actually happen. Can you explain what has happened since you gave your talk? RS: Sure. So, the Audacious grant allowed us to take our proven concept and to scale it. And the idea is that we are scaling this model across the country. We're currently in 18 different sites. And we are doing two things, right? The Bail Project is designed both, provide an immediate lifeline for folks that are stuck in jail cells simply because of poverty, because they can't pay their bail, and that's a response to the immediate direct emergency and human rights crisis that we have in this country around pretrial incarceration. But the second thing we're trying to do is we're testing a model that we call community release with voluntary supports. And what we're trying to prove is, A: you don't need cash bail, people will come back to court without cash bail. That myth has already been debunked and we know that. But we're also trying to model you can actually release people back to their communities with effective court notifications. Make sure they're connected to services they might need. And people will come back to court while their cases are open, and until those cases close. It is in an effort to move policy forward, to ensure the systemic change happens, but here's our fear: it's a race against time. Because as this conversation picks up speed, and as bail reform begins to take hold, some systems will move to new systems that we fear will recreate some of the same harms, right, that the initial bail system [created]. Those are racial disparities, economic inequality, and we can actually recreate that if we don't get this right. And so we're in a race against time to prove that you can do a community-based model that doesn't require electronic monitoring or risk algorithms or jail cells or cash bail, but that you can simply release people to communities with supports. And that will work. MZ: I want to come back to that in a minute, but before we do that, my background is as a tech journalist, and when you talk about scaling a program like this, I can only assume that you are facing completely different challenges than, say, a founder of an app or a platform or something like that. What are the challenges? I mean, you're going to states with different laws, each city must be so completely different. How do you do it? RS: So you know, scaling the revolving bail fund itself, that's been the easy, elegant solution, right? That's the easy part, that's direct service part, we can scale that across the country. The ground game, the teams that work as bail disruptors for the Bail Project at different locations across the country, they have to take our model and adapt it to the unique needs of each jurisdiction. And that's where it becomes complex, and it's very resource intensive, because criminal justice is incredibly local, and so how each system operates is unique. And what the needs of our clients are are incredibly different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. So you can be in Oklahoma and what you know is that communities have been ravaged by the opioid crisis, and when we're bringing people home, we have to connect them to services that might address that. When you're in Spokane, you're talking about an epidemic of homelessness. So when you're thinking about providing direct services and bringing people home, you have to be mindful of the fact that in that jurisdiction that may be the biggest obstacle for people, is that they don't have shelter. And so we need to adapt our model in every jurisdiction we go to to address the needs of that community. MZ: I could only assume that some of these communities are not so happy that you're there. That must be a reality of it. Do you have to win hearts and minds as well, in some of these places? RS: So I think it depends on the definition of community. So communities that have been targeted by our criminal legal system for generations, communities of color, low-income communities, marginalized communities, women across the country, they are more than happy to see us come, because we are just an immediate lifeline. Bail funds are a tool to get people out as an immediate lifeline, it's not a long-term, systemic answer, right? But people are, of course, they want to get out, go back to their families, their communities want them home. Has there been some opposition? Sure, of course. You know, when we go into a new site, we do so carefully, we prospect it carefully, we try to understand who are our partners on the ground that might help us in this initiative, grassroots organizers, not-for-profit organizations, systems holders, sheriffs, right? Who is going to support us and who our opposition might be. MZ: You also put some of the people that you bail out, you bring them back, right, as program officers. Is that part of the system that you're trying to make a community around your efforts in some way? RS: So when we're hiring for local jurisdictions, we always hire locally. If we open a site in Baton Rouge, we hire people from Baton Rouge and are connected to the community. We try to prioritize people with lived experience in the criminal legal system, or people who have been personally impacted by the system. We think it's important, they understand the system best, they have the best solutions because they're closest to the problem and they're credible messengers for the clients that we're going to be interviewing and providing bail for. MZ: So you touched on this, criminal justice reform has become a hot topic, you must be like, ""Yay, finally people are talking about this thing that I've been banging on about for decades."" Here in California actually, though, there has been a big change. Now it's complicated, but my understanding is that they're getting rid of cash bail. Good thing, bad thing, not quite that simple to explain? RS: So everything about criminal justice reform, and particularly bail reform, is way more complex than it looks, right? So it's easy to have a hashtag that says ""end cash bail."" Totally right. We have to eliminate unaffordable cash bail forever. We know money isn't what makes people come back, it's a myth, let's get rid of it. But the question about what comes next is very, very complex, and California was a good example. There was a bill that worked its way through the political process, called SB 10. It started out as what looked like a bill that would actually move towards more decarceration. By the time it came out of the political process, frankly it was a bill that almost nobody in the community would support, including the Bail Project. And it had gone through some changes in that process that placed, you know, pretrial services in the hands of law enforcement, that put people through risk algorithms, that sort of had a lot of the telltale signs of a system that was going to recreate the same racial inequity and economic inequalities that we had always seen, and so, that bill actually moved through the process, and we thought that was the end. But then the bail bond industry actually got 400,000 signatures to put it on the ballot. So in November, Californians will be voting on whether or not SB 10 should go forward or not. MZ: So Californians in the audience, you will be voting on this. How should they vote? RS: So I'm not so bold as to say that. I may be audacious, but I'm not that audacious. But what I will say is, educate yourselves. Understand what you're voting on. Understand what it means to hold somebody in jail who hasn't been convicted of a crime simply for their poverty, right? And ask yourselves, do we want to have a criminal legal system that incarcerates people before they've been convicted of a crime? Do we want to have a criminal legal system that continues to target communities of color and low-income communities across this country, do we want to continue the damage and the devastation that we have created through mass incarceration? So I'm not taking position on which way you should vote, but take that into account. MZ: She told me backstage, ""I'm not sure how I'm going to vote yet."" I mean, it's that difficult, right? RS: Well, it's a little more complicated. It's the form of SB 10 as it exists is not a bill that most of us would support, right? But eliminating cash bail is critical. MZ: Alright, I want you to forecast into the future. What does an ideal system look like? You have said that America is addicted to incarceration. Does there have to be a cultural shift around that in addition to making some of the changes that you're talking about? RS: So, you know, we have to reckon with what we've done. If we don't face head-on how we've used our criminal legal system, and who we have targeted, and how we've defined crime, and how we punish people, we're never going to move forward. So we are going to have to reckon with the harm that we've caused. And in so doing, we're going to have to shift our lens. And that's a real challenge for us, right? We're going to have to shift our lens from a system that's about punishment and cruelty and isolation and cages to a lens of, ""What do you need, how can we support, where have we failed, how can we make that better, how can we restore and how can we heal?"" And if we aren't willing to do that, criminal justice reform is going to be stalled, or what comes next is going to be really problematic. It is a fundamental shift in the way that we see our criminal justice system. And make no mistake about it, the context of our criminal legal system is we have turned our back on social problems, right? So we have turned our backs on homelessness and dire poverty and structural racism and mental health challenges and addiction and even immigration status. And instead, we have used our jails and our criminal legal system, right, to answer those problems. And that has to change. MZ: It's not the answer. RS: We have done damage to millions of people and in so doing, we have harmed their families and we have harmed their communities, and we need to reckon with that. MZ: So I want to ask you finally -- (Applause) You've got some of the smartest women in the world here, surrounding you. They're energized, they want to know what to do with that energy when they go back to their communities. And actually I know you took some of them to see a local jail yesterday, right? RS: I did. MZ: Can you tell us about that? RS: So, here's what we need to understand. This problem is all of our problems. Each and every one of us is implicated in what our criminal legal system looks like. There is no escaping that. It reflects each of us. Every time a prosecutor gets up and says, ""The people of the state of California"" or ""New York"" or ""Idaho,"" they are speaking in your names. So we have to take some ownership over this. And we really have to own the fact that this has to change and this implicates every one of us. So what you need to do, is as I said, you need to get educated, you also need to get proximate to this. And by getting proximate, I mean you need to go and see how our criminal legal system operates. That may mean go to a local criminal courthouse, sit in the back of a courtroom, and I promise you will never be the same, it's what made me become a public defender all those years ago. And yesterday, I took a bunch of people from the TED conference to the local jail here. I have been coming in and out of jails for 38 years. And I have never not been shocked, and yesterday was no exception. I was shocked, I was horrified. The conditions were dehumanizing and degrading and horrifying -- and incomprehensible if you don't actually see it with your eyes. It was shocking. And I saw it on the faces of the people that I was with. So we have to know that's what we're doing in the name of justice in this country and stand up against it. But the only way you're going to do that is if you fight back the narrative of fear that enables that to happen. And what do I mean by that? I promise you, every single time you get into a conversation about bail reform or criminal justice reform, here's what happens: everybody starts talking about the scary case. ""But what about the guy who did X?"" So here's what I'm here -- to rest -- Just have you rest a little bit and sit with this, right? Despite the fact that we have used our criminal legal system and destroyed millions of people, that we have harmed people, exposed them to trauma and violence, day after day after day, the truth is, when people come home, bad things happen rarely. It is the exception, not the rule. It is the extraordinary, not the normal. But if you don't know that, if you don't hold on to that, if you can't support that with data, which we can, you will be drawn into the narrative of fear that will lead us to justify the kinds of horrors we have inflicted upon communities of color and low-income communities and people that become ensnared in our criminal legal system for far too long. So get educated -- (Applause) Get educated, proximate, stay vigilant, do not be drawn into the narratives of fear, which are wildly and grossly racialized anyway. Check it when you hear it, question it when somebody says it to you, ask for the data, ""Why do you say that,"" right? And don't get drawn into that. And if you do, I'm actually convinced that we're at a moment where we will build a better criminal legal system. If you get proximate to this and you actually begin to engage in it, we will not only be a better country, each of us will be better people. And that is a worthy goal. MZ: It's a very worthy goal. (Applause) I mean, did I hit the jackpot with my first interview, or what? She is badass. Robin Steinberg, the Bail Project, thank you so much. RS: Thanks. MZ: I'm Manoush Zomorodi, I'm the new host of the TED Radio Hour, and I'll see you in the spring. (Applause)"
11:44,Huang Hung,How American and Chinese values shaped the coronavirus response,May 2020,"Helen Walters: Huang, it's so good to see you. Thank you for joining us. How's your 2020 been? Huang Hung: My 2020 started totally normal. In January, I went to Paris, did my interview for the fashion week there, came back to Beijing on January 22nd, and finding things a little bit tense because there were a lot of rumors. Having lived through SARS, I wasn't that concerned. And on the 23rd, I had a friend of mine from New York come to my house who had a flu, and we had dinner together, and another friend who came, who left the next day for Australia for vacation on an airplane. So we were not taking this terribly seriously until there was a lockdown. HW: And we've seen that echo around the world. I think still some people find it hard to understand the magnitude of some of the measures that China took. I mean -- what else are we missing about China's response in all of this? HH: You know, historically, we're just two very different countries in terms of culture and history. I mean, these are two completely different human experiences for its people. So, for China, when the lockdown happens, people are OK. People are OK with it, because they think that's what a good parent should do. You know, if a kid gets sick, you put him in the other room, and you lock him up and make sure that the other kids don't get sick. And they expect that out of the government. But when it is outside of China, from America, it becomes a huge issue of the right political thing to do and whether it's infringing on personal freedom. So the issues that you have to deal with in a democratic society are issues that one does not have to deal with in China. I have to say that there's a word in Chinese that doesn't exist in any other language, and the word is called ""guāi."" It is what you call a kid who listens to his or her parents. So I think, as a people, we are very ""guāi."" We have this sort of authoritarian figure that Chinese always look up to, and they do expect the government to actually take the actions, and they will deal with it. However much suffering there is, they feel that, OK, if big brother says that this has to be done, then it must be done. And that really defines China as a separate mentality, Chinese has a separate mentality, as, say, people in Europe and America. HW: That sense of collective responsibility sometimes feels a little absent from this culture. At the same time, there are, I think, valid concerns around surveillance and data privacy, things like that. What is the balance here, and what is the right trade-off between surveillance and freedom? HH: I think in the internet age, it is somewhere between China and the US. I think when you take individual freedom versus collective safety, there has to be a balance somewhere there. With surveillance, the head of Baidu, Robin Li, once said the Chinese people are quite willing to give up certain individual rights in exchange for convenience. Actually, he was completely criticized on Chinese social media, but I think he is right. Chinese people are willing to give up certain rights. For example, we have ... Chinese mostly are very proud of the payment system we have, which is you can go anywhere just with your iPhone and pay for everything, and all they do is face-scan. I think that probably freaks Americans out. You know, China right now, we're still under semi-lockdown, so if you go anywhere, there's an app where you scan and you input your mobile phone number, and the app will tell the guard at the entrance of the mall, for example, where you have been for the past 14 days. Now, when I told that to an American, she was horrified, and she thought it was such an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, as someone who is Chinese and has lived in China for the past 20 years, although I understand that American mentality, I still find I'm Chinese enough to think, ""I don't mind this, and I am better, I feel safer entering the mall because everybody has been scanned,"" whereas, I think individual freedom as an abstract concept in a pandemic like this is actually really meaningless. So I think the West really needs to move a step towards the East and to think about the collective as a whole rather than only think about oneself as an individual. HW: The rise of antagonistic rhetoric between the US and China is obviously troubling, and the thing is, the countries are interlinked whether people understand global supply chains or not. Where do you think we head next? HH: You know, this is the most horrifying thing that came out of this, the kind of nationalistic sentiments on both sides in this pandemic. Because I'm an optimist, I think what will come out of this is that both sides will realize that this is a fight that the entire human race has to do together and not apart. Despite the rhetoric, the global economy has grown to such an integration that decoupling will be extremely costly and painful for both the United States and China. HW: It's also been interesting to me to see the criticism that China has received quite vocally. For instance, they've been criticized for downplaying the death toll, arguably, also for trying to demonize Dr. Li, the Wuhan doctor who first raised the alarm about the coronavirus. I just saw a report in ""The New York Times"" that Weibo users have been posting repeatedly on the last post of Dr. Li and using this as kind of a living memorial to him, chatting to him. There's something like 870,000 comments and growing on that last post. Do you see a change in the media? Do you see a change in the approach to Chinese leadership that actually could lead to China swinging perhaps more to the center, just as perhaps America needs to swing more towards a Chinese model? HH: Unfortunately, not really, because I think there is a way between authoritarian governments and its people to communicate. The night that Dr. Li died, when it was announced that he died, the Chinese social media just blew up. Even though he was unjustly treated as a whistleblower, he still went to work in the hospital and tried to save lives as a doctor, and then he died because he contracted the disease. So there was anger, frustration, and all of that came out in kind of commemorating a figure that they feel that the government had wronged. The verdict and sort of the official voice on: ""Who is Dr. Li? Is he a good guy or a bad guy?"" completely changed 180 degrees. He went from a doctor who misbehaved to the hero who warned the people. So under authoritarian government, they still are very aware of public opinion, but, on the other hand, when people complain and when they commemorate Dr. Li, do they really want to change the system? And my answer is no, because they don't like that particular decision, but they don't want to change the system. And one of the reasons is because they have never, ever known another system. This is the system they know how to work. HW: What is wok-throwing, Huang? HH: Oh, wok-throwing is when you blame somebody else. Basically, someone who is responsible in a slang Chinese is someone who carries a black wok. You are made to be the scapegoat for something that is bad. So basically, Trump started calling it the ""Chinese virus,"" the ""Wuhan virus,"" and trying to blame the entire coronavirus pandemic on the Chinese. And then the Chinese, I think, threw the wok back at the Americans. So it was a very funny joke on Chinese social media, that wok-throwing. There's a wok-throwing gymnastics aerobics exercise video that went viral. HW: But tell us, Huang: You're also doing dances on TikTok, right? HH: Oh, of course. I'm doing a lot of wok-throwing aerobics on TikTok. HW: I mean, a potential silver lining of all of this is that it has laid bare some of the inequities, inequalities in the system, some of the broken structures that we have, and if we're smart, we can rebuild better. HH: Yes. I think one of the silver linings of this pandemic is that we do realize that the human race has to do something together rather than to be distinguished by our race, by the color of our skin or by our nationality; that this virus obviously is not discriminating against anyone, whether you are rich or poor, important or not important or whatever skin color or nationality you are. So it is a time to be together, rather than to try to pull the world apart and crawl back to our own nationalistic shells. HW: It's a beautiful sentiment. Huang Hung, thank you so much for joining us from Beijing. Stay well, please. HH: Thank you, Helen, and you stay well as well."
5:10,Brian A. Pavlac,What really happened during the Salem Witch Trials,May 2020,"You’ve been accused of a crime  you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty  and executed. But if you confess, apologize,  and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—  or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing  those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts  between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia  about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued  repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans,  a group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated  for the people of Salem. Battles with their  Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers  were strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought  one of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and  11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing  physically wrong — but diagnosed the girls  as under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked  havoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature,  conjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village,  the symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called  “afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits,  and complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three local women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered  outsiders in some way. On February 29th,  the authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother  of a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne, who had long been absent from church and was suing the family  of one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman  in Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing  witchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne  with having forced her. Osbourne and Good both  maintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s  husband turned against her in court, testifying that she ""was a witch  or would be one very quickly."" Good’s 4 year old daughter  was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony  against her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted  and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May, and then released. These three victims were  just the beginning. As accusations multiplied,  others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly  told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not  confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings,  they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised  not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds  of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when  supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further,  many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers, compromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out,  such as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693,  over a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women  and 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting  to spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even  the most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony  suspended the trials. Sentences were amended,  prisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls  were suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused  swelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason  for their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults  accepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain  a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink  and scapegoating, and the power of fear  to manipulate human perception."
4:17,Daina Ramey Berry,The electrifying speeches of Sojourner Truth,Apr 2020,"In early 1828, Sojourner Truth approached the Grand Jury of Kingston, New York. She had no experience  with the legal system, no money, and no power  in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold  to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out  over the next several months, Truth raised funds,  strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828,  Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate  the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery  as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced  the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of  indentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period,  enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented  from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man  named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep  her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition  threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont,  had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word,  Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able  to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children  remained in bondage. It would be two years before  she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait  another two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time,  Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated  to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community  that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking  aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice  of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known  as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on  Biblical references, spiritual ideals,  and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression  of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns  for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself  Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary  speaking tour. Truth saw her journey  as a mission from God. Her faith often led her  to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences  as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded  to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set  fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling  herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out  and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large,  my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer, until they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing  supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that  she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue  that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government. Truth continued to travel  and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883,  she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard  in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful  and will prevail."""
14:21,Heather C. McGhee,Racism has a cost for everyone,Apr 2020,"I am a public policy wonk. I investigate data that points to problems in the American economy -- problems like rising household debt, declining wages and benefits, shortfalls in public revenue. And I try to pinpoint solutions to make our economy more prosperous for more people. I geek out about tax policy and infrastructure investments, and I get really excited by a gracefully designed regulatory regime. (Laughter) These are the kinds of topics that I was talking about on a public television live call-in show in August of 2016. I was about halfway through the program when a man called in, identified as Gary from North Carolina and he said ... ""I'm a white male, and I'm prejudiced."" He then went on to detail his prejudice, talking about black men and gangs and drugs and crime. But then he said something that I'll never forget. He said, ""But I want to change. And I want to know what I can do to become a better American."" Now remember, my career is about economic policy, as translated into dollars and cents not personal thoughts and feelings. But when I opened my mouth to respond to this man on live television, the most surprising words came out. I said ... ""Thank you."" I thanked him for admitting his prejudice, for wanting to change and for knowing, somehow, that that would make him a better American. The exchange between Gary and me went viral. It's been viewed over eight million times and inspired waves of social media commentary and news coverage. And I think people were surprised that a black woman would show such compassion for a prejudiced white man, and they were surprised that a white man would admit his bias on national television. Not long after Gary and my viral moment, we met in person. He said that he had taken my advice. He said that my words had been like someone wiped the dust from a window and let the light in. Over the years, Gary and I have become friends. And Gary would tell you that I've taught him a lot about systemic racism in America and public policy. But I've learned a lot from Gary, too. And the biggest lesson for me has been that Gary's prejudice has caused him to suffer. Fear, anxiety, isolation. And it's made me rethink many of the economic problems I've been focusing on my entire career. I wondered, is it possible that our society's racism has likewise been backfiring on the very same people set up to benefit from privilege? Driven by this question, I've spent the past few years traveling the country, researching and writing a book. My conclusion? Racism leads to bad policymaking. It's making our economy worse. And not just in ways that disadvantage people of color. It turns out it's not a zero sum. Racism is bad for white people, too. Take, for example, America's underinvestment in our public goods, the things that we all need, that we share in common -- our schools and roads and bridges. Our infrastructure gets a D plus from the American Society of Civil Engineers, and we invest less per capita than almost every other advanced nation. But it wasn't always this way. I traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, and there, I saw how racism can destroy a public good and the public will to support it. In the 1930s and '40s, the United States went on a nationwide building boom of public amenities funded by tax dollars, which in Montgomery, Alabama, included the Oak Park pool, which was the grandest one for miles. You know, back then, people didn't have air conditioners, and so they spent their hot summer days in a steady rotation of sunning and splashing and then cooling off under a ring of nearby trees. It was the meeting place for the town. Except the Oak Park pool, though it was funded by all of Montgomery citizens, was for whites only. When a federal court finally deemed this unconstitutional, the reaction of the town council was swift. Effective January 1, 1959, they decided they would drain the public pool rather than let black families swim, too. This destruction of public goods was replicated across the country in towns not just in the South. Towns closed their public parks, pools and schools, all in response to desegregation orders, all throughout the 1960s. In Montgomery, they shut down the entire Parks Department for a decade. They closed the recreation centers, they even sold off the animals in the zoo. Today, you can walk the grounds of Oak Park, as I did, but very few people do. They never rebuilt the pool. Racism has a cost for everyone. I remember having that same thought on September 15, 2008, when I learned the breaking news that Lehman Brothers was collapsing. Now Lehman was, like the other financial firms that would go under in the coming days, done in by overexposure to a toxic financial instrument based on something that used to be simple and safe -- a 30-year fixed-rate home loan. But the mortgages at the center and the root of the financial crisis had strange new terms. And they were developed and aggressively marketed for years in black and brown middle-class communities, like the one that I visited when I met a homeowner named Glenn. Glenn had owned a home on a leafy street in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Cleveland for over a decade. But when I met him, he was near foreclosure. Like nearly all of his neighbors, he'd received a knock on the door from a broker promising to refinance his mortgage. But what the broker didn't tell him was that this was a new kind of mortgage. A mortgage with an inflated interest rate, and a balloon payment and a prepayment penalty if he tried to get out of it. Now, the common misperception, then and still today, is that people like Glenn were buying properties they couldn't afford. That they themselves were risky borrowers. I saw how this stereotype made it harder for policymakers to see the crisis for what it was back when we still had time to stop it. But that's all it was. A stereotype. The majority of subprime mortgages went to people who had good credit, like Glenn. And African Americans and Latinos were three times as likely -- even if they had good credit -- than white people, to get sold these toxic loans. The problem wasn't the borrower -- the problem was the loan. After the crash, most of the nation's big lenders, from Wells Fargo to Countrywide, would go on to be fined for racial discrimination. But that realization came too late. These loans, superprofitable for the lenders but designed to fail for the borrowers, spread out past the confines of black and brown neighborhoods like Glenn's and into the wider, whiter mortgage market. All of the nation's big Wall Street firms bet on these loans. At its peak, one out of every five mortgages in the country was in this mold, and the crisis, the crisis that my colleagues and I saw coming ... would go on to cost us all. Nineteen trillion in lost wealth. Pensions, home equity, savings. Eight million jobs vanished. A home-ownership rate that has never recovered. My years of advocating in vain for homeowners like Glenn left me convinced: we would not have had a financial crisis if it weren't for racism. In 2017, I traveled to Mississippi, where a group of auto-factory workers was trying to organize into a union. Now the benefits they were fighting for -- higher pay, better health care coverage, a real pension -- they would have helped everybody at the plant. But in person after person that I talked to -- white, black, for the union, against the union -- race kept coming up. A white man named Joey put it this way. He said, ""White workers think I ain't voting yes if the blacks are voting yes. If the blacks are for it, I'm against it."" A white man named Chip told me, ""The idea is that if you uplift black people, you're downing white people."" It's like the world's got this crab-in-a-barrel mentality. Now, the union vote failed. Wages at the plant are still lower than their unionized peers', and people there still worry about their health care. You know, it's tempting, perhaps, to focus on the prejudiced attitudes of the men and the workers that I heard in Mississippi. But I'm more interested in holding accountable the people who are selling racist ideas for their profit than those who are desperate enough to buy it. My travels also took me to places where I saw, however, that it doesn't have to be this way. I went to Maine, the whitest state in the nation, the oldest, where there are more deaths every year than births, and I went to this dying mill town called Lewiston that is being revitalized by new people -- mostly African, mostly Muslim, immigrants and refugees. There, I met a woman named Cecile, whose parents had been part of the last wave of new people to come to Lewiston. These are French-Canadian millworkers at the turn of the century. Cecile is retired, but she had found a new purpose in life, by organizing Congolese refugees to join with the white retirees at the Franco Heritage Center. (Laughter) These men and women from the Congo were helping these retirees remember the French that they hadn't spoken since their childhoods. And together, these two communities helped each other feel at home. You know, for all the political talk about the newcomers being a drain on the town, a bipartisan think tank found that the local refugee community there created 40 million dollars in tax revenue, and 130 million in income. And I talked to the town administrator, who was boasting about the fact that Lewiston was building a new school, when all the rest of towns like theirs in Maine was closing them. You know, it costs us so much to remain divided. This zero-sum thinking, that's what's good for one group has to come at the expense of another, it's what's gotten us into this mess. I believe it's time to reject that old paradigm and realize that our fates are linked. An injury to one is an injury to all. You know, we have a choice. Our nation was founded on a belief in a hierarchy of human value. But we are about to be a country with no racial majority. So we can keep pretending like we're not all on the same team. We can keep sabotaging our success and hamstringing our own players. Or we can let the proximity of so much difference reveal our common humanity. And we can finally invest in our greatest asset. Our people. All of our people. Thank you. (Applause)"
4:39,Riché D. Richardson,The hidden life of Rosa Parks,Apr 2020,"In 1944, 11 years before her fateful  decision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating  a vicious crime. As an emissary for  the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama  to meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been  sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend  Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests  throughout the South. When a jury failed  to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor  assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice  for all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly  challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems  protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her  mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear  of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently  drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws  segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury  at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter of the NAACP; a role many avoided  for fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager  to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined  the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were  the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes  for their meetings, and soon found herself elected  secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public  responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter, battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns  frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks  was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP  youth group council, she helped young people navigate  segregated systems including voter registration and  whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine  civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience training and spoke out against racial violence, particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move  to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement  she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed  for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four  hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred  and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed  nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended  when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating  public transport. But this victory for the movement  had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death  threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit  to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman  John Conyers to help support his burgeoning  civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial  inequality, Parks remained active  for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks to support other activists, and established an institute  for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered  as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful  people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done does away with fear.”"
14:53,Martha Minow,How forgiveness can create a more just legal system,Mar 2020,"Would you ever forgive a person who kills a member of your family? In September of 2019, Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced for murder, and then the brother of the victim forgave her. Brandt Jean was 18 years old, and I joined the rest of the country watching on television in awe at that act of grace. But I also worried. I worried that people who are African American like Brandt Jean are expected to forgive more often than other people. And I worried that a white police officer like Amber Guyger receives a lesser sentence than other people who commit wrongful killings. But because I'm a law professor, I also worried about the law itself. The law leans so severely towards punishment these days that it's part of the problem. And that's what I want to talk about here. The powerful example of one individual's forgiveness makes me worry that lawyers and officials too often overlook the tools that law itself creates to allow forgiveness, when the principle should be the cornerstone of a thriving society. I worry that lawyers and officials do not adequately use the tools of forgiveness, by which I mean letting go of justified grievance. And those tools are many. They include pardons, commutations, expungement, bankruptcy for debt and the discretion that's held by police and prosecutors and judges. But I also worry -- I worry a lot -- (Laughter) I worry that these tools, when used, replicate the disparities, the inequities along the lines of race and class and other markers of advantage and disadvantage. Biases or privileged access are at work when United States presidents pardon people charged with crimes. Historically, white people are pardoned four times as often as members of minority groups for the same crime, same sentence. Forgiveness between individuals is supported by every religious tradition, every philosophic tradition. And medical evidence now shows the health benefits of letting go of grievances and resentments. As Nelson Mandela led South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy, he explained, ""Resentment is like drinking a poison and hoping it will kill your enemies."" Law can remove the penalties for those who apologize and seek forgiveness. For example, in 39 states in the United States and the District of Columbia, there are laws that allow medical professionals to apologize when something goes wrong and not fear that that statement could later be used against them in an action for damages. More actively, bankruptcy law offers debtors, under some conditions, the chance to start anew. Pardons and expungements sealing criminal records can, too. I have been teaching law for almost 40 years, hard to believe, but recently, I realized that we don't teach law students about the tools of forgiveness that are within the legal system, and nor do law schools usually explore the potential for new avenues for forgiveness that law can adopt or assist. These are lost opportunities. These are lost obligations, even, because the students that I teach will become prosecutors, judges, governors, presidents. Barack Obama, my former student, used his power as the President of the United States to give pardons. That released several hundred people from prison after the law changed to provide shorter sentences for the same drug crimes for which they had been convicted. But if he hadn't used his pardon power, they would still be in prison. Legal tools of forgiveness should be used more, but not without reason and not with bias. A ""New Yorker"" cartoon shows a judge with a big nose and a big mustache looking down at a defendant with the exact same nose and exact same mustache and says, ""Obviously not guilty."" (Laughter) Forgiveness could undermine the commitment that law has to treat people the same under the same circumstances, to apply rules evenly. In this age of resentment, mass incarceration, widespread consumer debt, we need more forgiveness, but we need a philosophy of forgiveness. We need to forgive fairly. Contrast the treatment globally of child soldiers with the treatment of juvenile offenders in the United States. International human rights condemn and punish adults who involve children in armed conflict as those most responsible, but treat the children themselves quite differently. The International Criminal Court, now with 122 member nations, convicted Thomas Lubanga, warlord in the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo, for enlisting, recruiting and deploying children, teens, as soldiers. Many nations commit to ensuring that people under the age of 15 do not become child soldiers, and most nations treat those who do become soldiers not as objects of punishment but as people deserving a fresh start. Compare and contrast how the United States treats juvenile offenders, where we severely punish minors, often moving them to adult courts, even adult prisons. And yet, like child soldiers, teens and children are drawn into violent activity in the United States when there are few options, when they are threatened or when adults induce them with money or ideology. The rhetoric of innocence is resonant when we talk about child soldiers, but not when we talk about teen gang members in the United States. Yet in both settings, youth are caught in worlds that are made by adults, and forgiveness can offer both accountability and fresh starts. What if, instead, young people caught in criminal activity and violence could have chances to accept responsibility while learning and rebuilding their lives and their own communities? Legal frameworks inviting youth to describe their conduct could also involve community members to hear and forgive. Called ""restorative justice,"" such efforts emphasize accountability and service rather than punishment. Many schools in the United States have turned to use restorative justice methods to resolve conflicts and to prevent them, and to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. Some American high schools have replaced automatic suspensions with opportunities for victims to narrate their experiences and for offenders to take responsibility for their actions. As they describe their experiences and feelings about a theft or hateful graffiti or a verbal or physical assault, the victims and offenders often express strong emotions. And other members of the community take turns describing the impact of the offense on them. The leader is often a student peer, who is trained to deescalate the conflict and orchestrate a conversation about what the offender can do that would help the victim. Together, they come to an agreement about how to move forward, what the wrongdoer can do to repair the injury and what all could do to better avoid future conflicts. Consider this example, recently in a publication. A young woman named Mercedes M. transferred, in California, from one high school to another after she was so repeatedly suspended in her old high school for getting into fights. And here in her new high school, two other young women accused her of lying and called her the b-word. A counselor came over and talked to her and earned enough trust that she acknowledged she had stolen the shoes of one of the other classmates. Turns out, the three of them had known each other for a long time, and they didn't know any other way to deal with each other other than to fight. The facilitator invited them to participate in a circle, a confidential conversation about what happened, and they agreed. And initially, each of them expressed a lot of emotion. And then Mercedes apologized. And she said she had stolen the shoes, but she did so because she wanted to sell them and take the money to pay for a drug test so that her mother could show she was clean and try to regain custody of two younger children who were then in state protective care. The other girls heard this, saw Mercedes crying and they hugged her. They did not ask her to return what she'd stolen, but they did say they wanted a restart. They wanted a reason they could trust her. Later, Mercedes explained that she was sure she would have been suspended if they hadn't had this process. And her high school has reduced suspensions by more than half through the use of this kind of restorative justice method. Restorative justice alternatives involve offenders and victims in communicating in ways that an adversarial and defensive process does not allow, and it's become the go-to method in places like the District of Columbia juvenile justice system and innovations like Los Angeles's Teen Court. If tuned to fairness, forgiveness methods like bankruptcy would be available not only for the for-profit college that goes belly-up but also for the students stuck with the loans; pardons would not be given to campaign contributors; and black men would no longer have 20 percent longer criminal sentences than do white men, due to how judges exercise discretion. Forgiveness across the board is one way to avoid such biases. Sometimes, a society just needs a reset when it comes to punishment and debt. The Bible calls for periodic forgiveness of debts and freeing prisoners, and it recently helped to inspire a global movement. Jubilee 2000 joined Pope John Paul II and rock star Bono and over 60 nations in an effort to seek the cancellation and succeed in canceling the debt of developing countries, amounting to over 100 billion dollars of debt canceled, resulting in measurable reduction in poverty. In a similar spirit, there are people who are copying the techniques of commercial debt collectors who purchase debt for pennies on the dollar and then seek to enforce it. Late-night television host John Oliver partnered with a nonprofit group called RIP Medical Debt, and for only 60,000 dollars, they purchased 15 million dollars' worth of medical debt, and then they forgave it. (Applause) That allowed nearly 9,000 people to have a restart in their lives. This kind of precedent should trigger and encourage more such actions. It's time for a reset, given mass incarceration, medical and consumer debt and given indigent criminal defendants who are charged and put in debt because they're expected to pay for their own probation officers and their own electronic monitors. Forgiving violations of law or promises to pay back loans does pose risks. Forgiveness may encourage more violations. Economists even have a name for it. They call it ""moral hazard."" Should there be amnesty for immigration violations? Should a president offer pardons to protect himself or to induce lawbreaking? These are tough questions for our time. But escalating resentments hold their own dangers. So does attributing blame to individuals for circumstances largely outside their own control. To ask how law may forgive is not to deny the fact of wrongdoing. Rather, it's to widen the lens to enable glimpses of the larger patterns and to enable new choices that can go forward if we can wipe the slate clean. Thank you. (Applause)"
4:52,Alex Gendler,Epic Engineering: Building the Brooklyn Bridge,Feb 2020,"In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges  were collapsing all across Europe. Their industrial cables  frayed during turbulent weather and snapped  under the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer  named John Roebling proposed building the largest  and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived  over New York’s East River, city officials  were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan  was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn  clogged the river. In February of 1867, the government  approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures  of European bridges, Roebling designed  a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by  central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal  for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model  also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures  held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables,  Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight  on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used  for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here dwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope  would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for  over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand  over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures  in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident  his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat  crushed his foot against the dock. Within a month,  tetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son,  Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction  on the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction  was also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved  the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight  wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped  pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks  allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone  on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock,  they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s  permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons  were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps,  the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was  a mysterious ailment called ""the bends."" Today, we understand this  as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be  an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life  of the chief engineer. Washington survived,  but was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again,  the Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily  not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over  day-to-day project management. Unfortunately,  the bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget  and behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out  the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw  if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables  with additional wires, they suspended the deck  piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent  of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work  of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge  finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge  still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers  and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City."
12:34,Priti Krishtel,Why are drug prices so high? Investigating the outdated US patent system,Jan 2020,"For my husband, it was love at first sight. (Laughter) Here's what happened. Years ago, Rudy, who I had strictly put in the friend zone at the time, came over to my house and met my dad, a pharmaceutical scientist who had just retired after bringing a drug to market. My dad said, ""Ah, you probably wouldn't have heard of it. It's for IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."" Rudy paused for a long time, and then he said, ""That's the disease that took my father's life 15 years ago."" Rudy says that this is the moment he fell in love. (Laughter) With my father. (Laughter) Even though it was too late for my dad to save his, he felt that destiny had delivered us this full-circle moment. In my family, we have a special love for my father's inventions. And in particular, we have a reverence for his patents. We have framed patents on the wall in our house. And there's a recognition in our family that everything I've been able to do -- college, law school, health justice work -- all of it is because America enabled my father to fulfill his potential as an inventor. (Applause) Last year, I met the director of the US Patent Office for the first time, and I sent my family a selfie from that office in Virginia. (Laughter) I got so many emojis back, you would have thought I had met Beyoncé. (Laughter) But truth be told, I was actually there to talk about a problem -- how our outdated patent system is fueling the high cost of medicines and costing lives. Today, over two billion people live without access to medicines. And against this global crisis, drug prices are skyrocketing, including in wealthier countries. Thirty-four million Americans have lost a family member or a friend in the last five years, not because the treatment didn't exist, but because they couldn't afford it. Rising drug costs are pushing families into homelessness, seniors into bankruptcy and parents to crowdfunding treatment for their critically ill children. There are many reasons for this crisis, but one is the outdated patent system that America tries to export to the rest of the world. The original intention behind the patent system was to motivate people to invent by rewarding them with a time-limited monopoly. But today, that intention has been distorted beyond recognition. Corporations have teams of lawyers and lobbyists whose sole job is to extend patent protection as long as possible. And they've kept the patent office busy. It took 155 years for the US Patent Office to issue its first five million patents. It took just 27 years for it to issue the next five million. We haven't gotten drastically more inventive. Corporations have gotten drastically better at gaming the system. Drug patents have exploded -- between 2006 and 2016, they doubled. But consider this: The vast majority of medicines associated with new drug patents are not new. Nearly eight out of 10 are for existing ones, like insulin or aspirin. My organization, a team of lawyers and scientists, recently conducted an investigation into the 12 best-selling drugs in America. We found that, on average, there are 125 patents filed on each medicine. Often for things we've known how to do for decades, like putting two pills into one. The higher a patent wall a company builds, the longer they hold on to their monopoly. And with no one to compete with, they can set prices at whim. And because these are medicines and not designer watches, we have no choice but to pay. The patent wall is a strategy to block competition. Not for the 14 years maximum that America's founders originally envisioned, or the 20 years allowed by law today, but for 40 years or more. Meanwhile, prices on these drugs have continued to increase -- 68 percent since 2012. That's seven times the rate of inflation. And people are struggling or even dying, because they can't afford the meds. Now I want to be really clear about something. This isn't about making the pharmaceutical industry the bad guy. What I'm talking about today is whether the system we created to promote progress is actually working as intended. Sure, the pharmaceutical companies are gaming the system, but they're gaming it because they can. Because we have failed to adapt this system to meet today's realities. The government is handing out one of the most prized rewards in business -- the opportunity to create a product that is protected from competition -- and asking for less and less in return on our behalf. Imagine awarding 100 Pulitzer Prizes to one author for the same book. (Murmurs) It doesn't have to be this way. We can create a modern patent system to meet the needs of a 21st-century society. And to do that, we need to reimagine the patent system to serve the public, not just corporations. So how do we do it? Five reforms. First, we need to stop handing out so many patents. Back under the Kennedy administration, in an effort to curb rising drug costs, a congressman from Tennessee proposed an idea. He said, ""If you want to tweak a drug, and you want to get another patent on it, the modified version has to be significantly better, therapeutically, for patients."" Because of intense lobbying, this idea never saw the light of day. But a reimagined patent system would resurrect and evolve this simple, yet elegant proposition. That to get a patent, you have to invent something substantially better than what's already out there. This shouldn't be controversial. As a society, we reserve the big rewards for the big ideas. We don't give Michelin stars to chefs who just tweak a recipe -- we give them to chefs who change how we think about food. And yet, we hand out patents worth billions of dollars for minor changes. It's time to raise the bar. Second, we need to change the financial incentives of the Patent Office. Right now, the revenue of the Patent Office is directly linked to the number of patents that it grants. That's like private prisons getting paid more to hold more people -- it naturally leads to more incarceration, not less. The same is true for patents. Third, we need more public participation. Right now, the patent system is like a black box. It's a two-way conversation between the patent office and industry. You and I aren't invited to that party. But imagine if instead, the Patent Office became a dynamic center for citizen learning and ingenuity, staffed not just by technical experts and bureaucrats, but also by great public-health storytellers with a passion for science. Regular citizens could get accessible information about complex technologies like artificial intelligence or gene editing, enabling us to participate in the policy conversations that directly impact our health and lives. Fourth, we need to get the right to go to court. Right now in America, after a patent is granted, the public has no legal standing. Only those with a commercial interest, usually other drug companies, have that right. But I've witnessed firsthand how lives can be saved when everyday citizens have the right to go to court. Back in 2006 in India, my organization worked with patient advocates to challenge, legally, unjust HIV drug patents, at a time when so many people were dying, because medicines were priced out of reach. We were able to bring down the prices of medicines by up to 87 percent. (Applause) On just three drugs, we were able to save health systems half a billion dollars. Now, cases like these can save millions of lives and billions of dollars. Imagine if Americans had the right to go to court, too. And lastly, we need stronger oversight. We need an independent unit that can serve as a public advocate, regularly monitoring the activities of the Patent Office and reporting to Congress. If a unit like this had existed, it would have caught, for example, the Silicon Valley company Theranos before it got so many patents for blood testing and landed an evaluation of nine billion dollars, when in reality, there was no invention there at all. This kind of accountability is going to become increasingly urgent. In the age of 23andMe, important questions are being asked about whether companies can patent and sell our genetic information and our patient data. We need to be part of those conversations before it's too late. Our information is being used to create the new therapies. And when that moment of diagnosis comes for me and my family, or for you and yours, are we going to have to crowdfund to save the lives of those we love? That's not the world I want to live in. It's not the world I want for my two-year-old son. My dad is growing older now, and he is still as quietly brilliant and morally directed as ever. Sometimes people ask us whether things get heated between us: the patent-holding scientist and his patent-reforming lawyer daughter. It's such a profound misunderstanding of what's at stake, because this is not about scientists versus activists, or invention versus protection. This is about people, our quest to invent and our right to live. My dad and I understand that our ingenuity and our dignity go hand in hand. We are on the same side. It is time to reimagine a patent system that reflects that knowing. Thank you. (Applause)"
10:56,David J. Bier,How guest worker visas could transform the US immigration system,Jan 2020,"By October 2018, Juan Carlos Rivera could no longer afford to live in his home in Copan, Honduras. As the ""Dallas Morning News"" reported, a gang was taking 10 percent of his earnings from his barber shop. His wife was assaulted going to her pre-K teaching job. And they were concerned about the safety of their young daughter. What could they do? Run away? Seek asylum in another country? They didn't want to do that. They just wanted to live in their country safely. But their options were limited. So that month, Juan Carlos moved his family to a safer location while he joined a group of migrants on the long and perilous journey from Central America to a job a family member said was open for him in the United States. By now we're all familiar with what awaited them at the US-Mexico border. The harsher and harsher penalties doled out to those crossing there. The criminal prosecutions for crossing illegally. The inhumane detention. And most terribly, separation of families. I'm here to tell you that not only is this treatment wrong, it's unnecessary. This belief that the only way to maintain order is with inhumane means is inaccurate. And in fact, the opposite is true. Only a humane system will create order at the border. When safe, orderly, legal travel to the United States is available, very few people choose travel that is unsafe, disorderly or illegal. Now, I appreciate the idea that legal immigration could just resolve the border crisis might sound a bit fanciful. But here is the good news: We have done this before. I've been working on immigration for years at the Cato Institute and other think tanks in Washington DC and as the senior policy adviser for a republican member of Congress, negotiating bipartisan immigration reform. And I've seen firsthand how America has implemented a system of humane order at the border for Mexico. It's called a guest worker program. And here's the even better news. We can replicate this success for Central America. Of course, some people will still need to seek asylum at the border. But to understand how successful this could be for immigrants like Juan Carlos, understand that until recently, nearly every immigrant arrested by Border Patrol was Mexican. In 1986, each Border Patrol agent arrested 510 Mexicans. Well over one per day. By 2019, this number was just eight. That's one every 43 days. It is a 98 percent reduction. So where have all the Mexicans gone? The most significant change is that the US began issuing hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas to Mexicans, so that they can come legally. José Vásquez Cabrera was among the first Mexican guest workers to take advantage of this visa expansion. He told ""The New York Times"" that before his visa he'd made terrifying illegal border crossings, braving near deadly heat and the treachery of the landscape. One time, a snake killed a member of his group. Thousands of other Mexicans also didn't make it, dying of dehydration in the deserts or drowning in the Rio Grande. Millions more were chased down and arrested. Guest worker visas have nearly ended this inhumane chaos. As Vásquez Cabrera put it, ""I no longer have to risk my life to support my family. And when I'm here, I don't have to live in hiding."" Guest worker visas actually reduced the number of illegal crossings more than the number of visas issued. Jose Bacilio, another Mexican guest worker, explained why to the ""Washington Post"" in April. He said, even though he hadn't received a visa this year, he wouldn't risk all of his future chances by crossing illegally. This likely helps explain why from 1996 to 2019 for every guest worker admitted legally from Mexico, there was a decline in two arrests of Mexicans crossing illegally. Now, it's true, Mexican guest workers do some really tough jobs. Picking fruit, cleaning crabs, landscaping in a 100-degree heat. And some critics maintain that guest worker visas are not actually humane and that the workers are just abused slaves. But Vásquez Cabrera thought a guest worker visa was liberating. Not enslavement. And he, like nearly all other guest workers, chose the legal path over the illegal one, repeatedly. The expansion of guest worker visas to Mexicans has been among the most significant humane changes in US immigration policy ever. And that humane change imposed order on chaos. So where does this leave Central Americans, like Juan Carlos? Well, Central Americans received just three percent of the guest worker visas issued in 2019, even as their share of border arrests has risen to 74 percent. The US issued just one guest worker visa to a Central American for every 78 who crossed the border illegally in 2019. So if they can't get their papers at home, many take their chances, coming up through Mexico to claim asylum at the border or cross illegally, even if, like Juan Carlos, they prefer to come to work. The US can do better. It needs to create new guest worker visas specifically for Central Americans. This would create an incentive for US businesses to seek out and hire Central Americans, paying for their flights to the United States, and diverting them from the illegal, dangerous trek north. Central Americans could build flourishing lives at home, without the need to seek asylum at the border or cross illegally, freeing up an overwhelmed system. Some people might say that letting the workers go back and forth will never work in Central America where violence is so high. But again, it worked in Mexico, even as Mexico's murder rate more than tripled over the last decade, to a level higher than much of Central America. And it would work for Juan Carlos, who said, despite the threats he only wants to live in the United States temporarily, to make enough money to sustain his family in their new home. He even suggested that a guest worker program would be one of the best things to help Hondurans like him. Cintia, a 29-year-old single mother of three from Honduras, seems to agree. She told the ""Wall Street Journal"" that she came for a job to support her kids and her mom. Surveys of Central Americans traveling through Mexico, by the College of the Northern Border in Mexico, confirm that Juan and Cintia are the norm. Most, not all, but most do come for jobs, even if, like the Riveras, they may also face some real threats at home. How much would a low-wage job help a Honduran, like Juan or Cintia? Hondurans like them make as much in one month in the United States as they do in an entire year working in Honduras. A few years' work in the United States can propel a Central American into its upper middle class where safety is easier to come by. What Central Americans lack is not the desire to work. Not the desire to contribute to the US economy, to contribute to the lives of Americans. What Central Americans lack is a legal alternative to asylum. To be able to do so legally. Of course, a new guest worker program will not resolve 100 percent of this complex phenomenon. Many asylum seekers will still need to seek safety at the US border. But with the flows reduced, we can more easily work out ways to deal with them humanely. But ultimately, no single policy has proven to do more to create an immigration system that is both humane and orderly than to let the workers come legally. Thank you. (Applause)"
7:59,Anindya Kundu,"The ""opportunity gap"" in US public education — and how to close it",Jan 2020,"My first job out of college was as an academic researcher at one of the largest juvenile detention centers in the country. And every day I would drive to this building on the West Side of Chicago, go through the security checkpoint and walk down these brown, brick hallways as I made my way down to the basement to observe the intake process. The kids coming in were about 10 to 16 years old, usually always black and brown, most likely from the same impoverished South and West Sides of Chicago. They should've been in fifth to tenth grade, but instead they were here for weeks on end awaiting trial for various crimes. Some of them came back to the facility 14 times before their 15th birthday. And as I sat there on the other side of the glass from them, idealistic with a college degree, I wondered to myself: Why didn't schools do something more to prevent this from happening? It's been about 10 years since then, and I still think about how some kids get tracked towards college and others towards detention, but I no longer think about schools' abilities to solve these things. You see, I've learned that so much of this problem is systemic that often our school system perpetuates the social divide. It makes worse what it's supposed to fix. That's as crazy or controversial as saying that our health care system isn't preventative but somehow profits off of keeping us sick ... oops. (Laughter) I truly do believe though that kids can achieve great things despite the odds against them, and in fact, my own research shows that. But if we're serious about helping more kids from across the board to achieve and make it in this world, we're going to have to realize that our gaps in student outcomes are not so much about achievement as much as they are about opportunity. A 2019 EdBuild report showed that majority-white districts receive about 23 billion dollars more in annual funding than nonwhite districts, even though they serve about the same number of students. Lower resource schools are dealing with lower quality equipment, obsolete technology and paying teachers way less. Here in New York, those are also the schools most likely to serve the one in 10 elementary school students who will most likely have to sleep in a homeless shelter tonight. The student, parent and teacher are dealing with a lot. Sometimes places are misplacing the blame back on them. In Atlanta, we saw that teachers felt desperate enough to have to help their students cheat on standardized tests that would impact their funding. Eight of them went to jail for that in 2015 with some sentences as high as 20 years, which is more than what many states give for second-degree murder. The thing is though, in places like Tulsa, teachers' pay has been so bad that these people have had to go to food pantries or soup kitchens just to feed themselves. The same system will criminalize a parent who will use a relative's address to send their child to a better school, but for who knows how long authorities have turned a blind eye to those who can bribe their way onto the most elite and beautiful college campuses. And a lot of this feels pretty heavy to be saying -- and maybe to be hearing -- and since there's nothing quite like economics talk to lighten the mood -- that's right, right? Let me tell you about some of the costs when we fail to tap into our students' potential. A McKinsey study showed that if in 1998 we could've closed our long-standing student achievement gaps between students of different ethnic backgrounds or students of different income levels, by 2008, our GDP -- our untapped economic gains -- could have gone up by more than 500 billion dollars. Those same gaps in 2008, between our students here in the US and those across the world, may have deprived our economy of up to 2.3 trillion dollars of economic output. But beyond economics, numbers and figures, I think there's a simpler reason that this matters, a simpler reason for fixing our system. It's that in a true democracy, like the one we pride ourselves on having -- and sometimes rightfully so -- a child's future should not be predetermined by the circumstances of their birth. A public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top. Some of us can sometimes think that these things aren't that close to home, but they are if we broaden our view, because a leaky faucet in our kitchen, broken radiator in our hallway, those parts of the house that we always say we're going to get to next week, they're devaluing our whole property. Instead of constantly looking away to solutions like privatization or the charter school movement to solve our problems, why don't we take a deeper look at public education, try to take more pride in it and maybe use it to solve some of our social problems. Why don't we try to reclaim the promise of public education and remember that it's our greatest collective responsibility? Luckily some of our communities are doing just that. The huge teacher strikes in the spring of 2019 in Denver and LA -- they were successful because of community support for things like smaller class sizes and getting things into schools like more counselors in addition to teacher pay. And sometimes for the student, innovation is just daring to implement common sense. In Baltimore a few years ago, they enacted a free breakfast and lunch program, taking away the stigma of poverty and hunger for some students but increasing achievement in attendance for many others. And in Memphis, the university is recruiting local, passionate high school students and giving them scholarships to go teach in the inner city without the burden of college debt. And north of here in The Bronx, I recently researched these partnerships being built between high schools, community colleges and local businesses who are creating internships in finance, health care and technology for students without ""silver spoon"" connections to gain important skills and contribute to the communities that they come from. So today I don't necessarily have the same questions about education that I did when I was an idealistic, perhaps naïve college grad working in a detention center basement. It's not: Can schools save more of our students? Because I think we have the answer to that -- and it's yes they can, if we save our schools first. We can start by caring about the education of other people's children ... And I'm saying that as someone who doesn't have kids yet but wants to worry a little bit less about the future when I do. Cultivating as much talent as possible, getting as many girls as we can from all over into science and engineering, as many boys as we can into teaching -- those are investments for our future. Our students are like our most valuable resource, and when you put it that way, our teachers are like our modern-day diamond and gold miners, hoping to help make them shine. Let's contribute our voices, our votes and our support to giving them the resources that they will need not just to survive but hopefully thrive, allowing all of us to do so as well. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"
3:33,Sheila Marie Orfano,"Why should you read ""The Joy Luck Club"" by Amy Tan?",Dec 2019,"In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner  of the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west  corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families  comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei,  and play mahjong. However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s  mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles  to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply  buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot  to learn about her mother, and herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel,  ""The Joy Luck Club,"" this gathering at the mahjong table  is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured  to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four  rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts,  each with four chapters. Alternately set in China  or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single  story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club  or their American-born daughters. These stories take the reader through  war zones and villages of rural China,  and into modern marriages and tense gatherings  around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival  and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape  from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading  to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American  day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the  responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes  the family for years to come. These tales illustrate the common  divides that can form between generations and cultures,  especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great  hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly  to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down  by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays  mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see  their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths  and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their  daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters  struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them  with who they really are. ""Does my daughter know me?""  some of the stories ask. ""Why doesn’t my mother understand?""  others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties  that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated  from their homeland and disconnected  from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these  four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle  their present-day problems through the values their mothers  passed on to them. When ""The Joy Luck Club""  was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions,  the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters  still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak  to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood  by the ones you love."
5:01,Chris A. Kniesly,How corn conquered the world,Dec 2019,"Corn currently accounts for more than  one tenth of our global crop production. The United States alone has enough  cornfields to cover Germany. But while other crops we grow  come in a range of varieties, over 99% of cultivated corn is the  exact same type: Yellow Dent #2. This means that humans grow  more Yellow Dent #2 than any other plant on the planet. So how did this single variety  of this single plant become the biggest success story  in agricultural history? Nearly 9,000 years ago, corn,  also called maize, was first domesticated from teosinte,  a grass native to Mesoamerica. Teosinte’s rock-hard seeds  were barely edible, but its fibrous husk could be turned  into a versatile material. Over the next 4,700 years, farmers bred  the plant into a staple crop, with larger cobs and edible kernels. As maize spread throughout the Americas,  it took on an important role, with multiple indigenous societies  revering a “Corn Mother” as the goddess who created agriculture. When Europeans first arrived in America,  they shunned the strange plant. Many even believed it was the source of  physical and cultural differences between them and the Mesoamericans. However, their attempts to cultivate European crops in American soil quickly failed, and the settlers were forced  to expand their diet. Finding the crop to their taste,  maize soon crossed the Atlantic, where its ability to grow in diverse  climates made it a popular grain in many European countries. But the newly established United States  was still the corn capital of the world. In the early 1800’s, different regions  across the country produced strains of varying  size and taste. In the 1850’s, however, these unique varieties proved difficult  for train operators to package, and for traders to sell. Trade boards in rail hubs like Chicago  encouraged corn farmers to breed one standardized crop. This dream would finally be  realized at 1893’s World’s Fair, where James Reid’s yellow dent corn  won the Blue Ribbon. Over the next 50 years, yellow dent  corn swept the nation. Following the technological  developments of World War II, mechanized harvesters became  widely available. This meant a batch of corn that previously took a full day to harvest by hand could now be collected in just 5 minutes. Another wartime technology, the chemical  explosive ammonium nitrate, also found new life on the farm. With this new synthetic fertilizer, farmers could plant dense fields  of corn year after year, without the need to rotate their crops  and restore nitrogen to the soil. While these advances made corn an  attractive crop to American farmers, US agricultural policy limited the  amount farmers could grow to ensure high sale prices. But in 1972, President Richard Nixon  removed these limitations while negotiating massive grain  sales to the Soviet Union. With this new trade deal  and WWII technology, corn production exploded into  a global phenomenon. These mountains of maize inspired  numerous corn concoctions. Cornstarch could be used as a thickening  agent for everything from gasoline to glue or processed into a low-cost sweetener  known as High-Fructose Corn Syrup. Maize quickly became one of the  cheapest animal feeds worldwide. This allowed for inexpensive  meat production, which in turn increased the demand  for meat and corn feed. Today, humans eat only 40% of  all cultivated corn, while the remaining 60% supports consumer  good industries worldwide. Yet the spread of this wonder-crop  has come at a price. Global water sources are polluted by  excess ammonium nitrate from cornfields. Corn accounts for a large portion of  agriculture-related carbon emissions, partly due to the increased meat  production it enables. The use of high fructose corn syrup may  be a contributor to diabetes and obesity. And the rise of monoculture farming has left our food supply dangerously  vulnerable to pests and pathogens— a single virus could infect the world’s  supply of this ubiquitous crop. Corn has gone from a bushy grass to an essential element of the  world’s industries. But only time will tell if it has led us  into a maze of unsustainability."
10:40,Amma Y. Ghartey-Tagoe Kootin,A historical musical that examines Black identity in the 1901 World's Fair,Nov 2019,"The archive. One may envision rooms and shelves stocked with boxes and cartons of old stuff. And yet, for those who are patient enough to dig through it, the archive provides the precious opportunity to touch the past, to feel and learn from the experiences of once-living people who now seem dead and buried deeply in the archive. But what if there was a way to bring the archive to life? Jon Michael Reese: ""The world is thinking wrong about race."" Melissa Joyner: ""This country insists upon judging the Negro."" JMR: ""Because it does not know."" AYGTK: What if one could make it breathe? MJ: ""By his lowest and most vicious representatives."" AYGTK: Speak. JMR: ""An honest, straightforward exhibit."" AYGTK: And even sing to us, so that the archive becomes accessible to everyone. What would performing the archive look like? A performance that is not simply based on a true story but one that allows us to come face-to-face with things we thought were once dead and buried. (Piano music) This is what ""At Buffalo,"" a new musical we're developing, is all about. Using collections from over 30 archival institutions, ""At Buffalo"" performs the massive archive of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the first World's Fair of the 20th century, held in Buffalo, New York. Now, if you've heard of this fair, it might be because this is where then-US president, William McKinley, was assassinated. For nearly 17 years, I've stayed inside the gates and the archive of this fair, not only because of that story but because of a real life-and-death racial drama that played out on the fairgrounds. Here, in a place that was like Disney World, the Olympics, carnivals, museums, all in one, there were three conflicting displays of what it meant to be black in the United States. The archive says white showmen presented a savage black origin in the form of 98 West and Central Africans, living and performing war dances in a recreated village called Darkest Africa. And across the street, a happy slave life, in the form of 150 Southern black performers, picking cotton, singing and dancing minstrel shows in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old Plantation. As a response, the black Buffalo community championed the third display of blackness: the Negro Exhibit. Codesigned by African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, it curated photographs, charts, books and more, to show black Americans as a high-achieving race, capable of education and progress. When I first encountered this story, I understood from my own life experience what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora see each other like this. For me, as the child of immigrant parents from Ghana, West Africa, born in the American South, raised in Manhattan, Kansas, (Laughter) and having attended the same elite school as Du Bois, I could see that the Buffalo fair effectively pitted the black Northerner against the Southerner, the educated against the uneducated, and the African American against the African. And I wanted to know: How did these three distinct groups of black folk navigate this experience? Unfortunately, the archive had answers to questions like this underneath racial caricature, conflicting information and worse -- silence. (Piano music) Still, I could hear musical melodies and see dance numbers and the rhythms of the words coming off the pages of old newspaper articles. And learning that this World's Fair had music playing everywhere on its fairgrounds, I knew that live, immersive, spectacular musical theater, with the latest technologies of our time, is the closest experience that can bring the archival story of the 1901 fair out of boxes and into life. Stories, like Tannie and Henrietta, a husband and wife vaudeville duo in love who become at odds over performing these ""coon"" minstrel shows while striving for their five-dollar-a-week dream in the Old Plantation attraction. Like African businessman John Tevi, from present-day Togo, who must outwit the savage rules of the human zoo in which he has become trapped. And stories like Mary Talbert, a wealthy leader of the black Buffalo elite, who must come to terms with the racial realities of her home town. MJ: ""The dominant race in this country insists upon judging the Negro by his lowest and most vicious representatives."" AYGTK: Like Old Plantation and Darkest Africa. MJ: ""... instead of by the more intelligent and worthy classes."" AYGTK: When fair directors ignored Mary Talbert and the local black Buffalo community's request to participate in the fair, newspapers say that Mary Talbert and her club of educated African American women held a rousing protest meeting. But the details of that meeting, even down to the fiery speech she gave, were not fully captured in the archive. So, ""At Buffalo"" takes the essence of Mary's speech and turns it into song. (All singing) We must, we are unanimous. We must, we are unanimous. MJ: We've got something to show -- we're going to teach a lesson in Buffalo. It would benefit the nation to see our growth since emancipation. Colored people should be represented in this Pan-American exposition, it would benefit the nation to see our growth since emancipation. (All singing) They made a great mistake not to appoint someone from the race. We must, we are unanimous. We must, we are unanimous. We must, we are unanimous. AYGTK: Mary Talbert successfully demands that the Negro Exhibit come to the fair. And to have the Negro Exhibit in Buffalo means that the musical must tell the story behind why Du Bois cocreated it ... and why Mary and the black elite felt it was urgently needed. JMR: ""The world is thinking wrong about race. They killed Sam Hose for who they thought he was. And more men like him, every day, more Negro men, like him, taken apart. And after that -- that red ray ... we can never be the same. (Singing) A red ray [A man hunt in Georgia] cut across my desk [Mob after Hose; he will be lynched if caught] the very day Sam's hands were laid to rest. Can words alone withstand the laws unjust? [Escape seems impossible] Can words alone withstand the violence? Oh, no, oh. [Burned alive] [Sam Hose is lynched] Oh, no, oh. [His body cut in many pieces] Oh, no, oh. [Burned at the Stake] [Ten Cents Slice Cooked Liver.] [Fight for souvenirs.] (Both singing) Who has read the books? Our numbers and statistics look small against the page. The crisis has multiplied. Our people are lynched and died. Oh, Lord. Something must change. AYGTK: Something must change. ""At Buffalo"" reveals how the United States today stands at similar crossroads as 1901 America. Just as the name of Sam Hose filled newspapers back then, today's media carries the names of: JMR: Oscar Grant. MJ: Jacqueline Culp. Pianist: Trayvon Martin. AYGTK: Sandra Bland. And too many others. The 1901 fair's legacies persist in more ways than we can imagine. MJ: Mary Talbert and the National Association of Colored Women started movements against lynching and the myth of black criminality just as black women today started Black Lives Matter. JMR: And some of the same people who fought for and created the Negro Exhibit, including Du Bois, came to Buffalo, four years after the fair, to start the Niagara Movement, which set the groundwork for the creation of the NAACP. AYGTK: It's not just black folks who had a peculiar experience at the 1901 fair. An official handbook informed fair-goers: MJ: ""Please remember:"" JMR: ""... once you get inside the gate,"" AYGTK: ""... you are a part of the show."" Performing the archive in ""At Buffalo"" allows audiences to ask themselves, ""Are we still inside the gates, and are we all still part of the show?"" (Music ends) (Applause and cheers)"
16:31,Paul A. Kramer,Our immigration conversation is broken — here's how to have a better one,Nov 2019,"We often hear these days that the immigration system is broken. I want to make the case today that our immigration conversation is broken and to suggest some ways that, together, we might build a better one. In order to do that, I'm going to propose some new questions about immigration, the United States and the world, questions that might move the borders of the immigration debate. I'm not going to begin with the feverish argument that we're currently having, even as the lives and well-being of immigrants are being put at risk at the US border and far beyond it. Instead, I'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid-1990s, earnestly studying US history, which is what I currently teach as a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. And when I wasn't studying, sometimes to avoid writing my dissertation, my friends and I would go into town to hand out neon-colored flyers, protesting legislation that was threatening to take away immigrants' rights. Our flyers were sincere, they were well-meaning, they were factually accurate ... But I realize now, they were also kind of a problem. Here's what they said: ""Don't take away immigrant rights to public education, to medical services, to the social safety net. They work hard. They pay taxes. They're law-abiding. They use social services less than Americans do. They're eager to learn English, and their children serve in the US military all over the world."" Now, these are, of course, arguments that we hear every day. Immigrants and their advocates use them as they confront those who would deny immigrants their rights or even exclude them from society. And up to a certain point, it makes perfect sense that these would be the kinds of claims that immigrants' defenders would turn to. But in the long term, and maybe even in the short term, I think these arguments can be counterproductive. Why? Because it's always an uphill battle to defend yourself on your opponent's terrain. And, unwittingly, the handouts my friends and I were handing out and the versions of these arguments that we hear today were actually playing the anti-immigrants game. We were playing that game in part by envisioning that immigrants were outsiders, rather than, as I'm hoping to suggest in a few minutes, people that are already, in important ways, on the inside. It's those who are hostile to immigrants, the nativists, who have succeeded in framing the immigration debate around three main questions. First, there's the question of whether immigrants can be useful tools. How can we use immigrants? Will they make us richer and stronger? The nativist answer to this question is no, immigrants have little or nothing to offer. The second question is whether immigrants are others. Can immigrants become more like us? Are they capable of becoming more like us? Are they capable of assimilating? Are they willing to assimilate? Here, again, the nativist answer is no, immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us. And the third question is whether immigrants are parasites. Are they dangerous to us? And will they drain our resources? Here, the nativist answer is yes and yes, immigrants pose a threat and they sap our wealth. I would suggest that these three questions and the nativist animus behind them have succeeded in framing the larger contours of the immigration debate. These questions are anti-immigrant and nativist at their core, built around a kind of hierarchical division of insiders and outsiders, us and them, in which only we matter, and they don't. And what gives these questions traction and power beyond the circle of committed nativists is the way they tap into an everyday, seemingly harmless sense of national belonging and activate it, heighten it and inflame it. Nativists commit themselves to making stark distinctions between insiders and outsiders. But the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves. The fissures between inside and outside, which often run deepest along lines of race and religion, are always there to be deepened and exploited. And that potentially gives nativist approaches resonance far beyond those who consider themselves anti-immigrant, and remarkably, even among some who consider themselves pro-immigrant. So, for example, when Immigrants Act allies answer these questions the nativists are posing, they take them seriously. They legitimate those questions and, to some extent, the anti-immigrant assumptions that are behind them. When we take these questions seriously without even knowing it, we're reinforcing the closed, exclusionary borders of the immigration conversation. So how did we get here? How did these become the leading ways that we talk about immigration? Here, we need some backstory, which is where my history training comes in. During the first century of the US's status as an independent nation, it did very little to restrict immigration at the national level. In fact, many policymakers and employers worked hard to recruit immigrants to build up industry and to serve as settlers, to seize the continent. But after the Civil War, nativist voices rose in volume and in power. The Asian, Latin American, Caribbean and European immigrants who dug Americans' canals, cooked their dinners, fought their wars and put their children to bed at night were met with a new and intense xenophobia, which cast immigrants as permanent outsiders who should never be allowed to become insiders. By the mid-1920s, the nativists had won, erecting racist laws that closed out untold numbers of vulnerable immigrants and refugees. Immigrants and their allies did their best to fight back, but they found themselves on the defensive, caught in some ways in the nativists' frames. When nativists said that immigrants weren't useful, their allies said yes, they are. When nativists accused immigrants of being others, their allies promised that they would assimilate. When nativists charged that immigrants were dangerous parasites, their allies emphasized their loyalty, their obedience, their hard work and their thrift. Even as advocates welcomed immigrants, many still regarded immigrants as outsiders to be pitied, to be rescued, to be uplifted and to be tolerated, but never fully brought inside as equals in rights and respect. After World War II, and especially from the mid-1960s until really recently, immigrants and their allies turned the tide, overthrowing mid-20th century restriction and winning instead a new system that prioritized family reunification, the admission of refugees and the admission of those with special skills. But even then, they didn't succeed in fundamentally changing the terms of the debate, and so that framework endured, ready to be taken up again in our own convulsive moment. That conversation is broken. The old questions are harmful and divisive. So how do we get from that conversation to one that's more likely to get us closer to a world that is fairer, that is more just, that's more secure? I want to suggest that what we have to do is one of the hardest things that any society can do: to redraw the boundaries of who counts, of whose life, whose rights and whose thriving matters. We need to redraw the boundaries. We need to redraw the borders of us. In order to do that, we need to first take on a worldview that's widely held but also seriously flawed. According to that worldview, there's the inside of the national boundaries, inside the nation, which is where we live, work and mind our own business. And then there's the outside; there's everywhere else. According to this worldview, when immigrants cross into the nation, they're moving from the outside to the inside, but they remain outsiders. Any power or resources they receive are gifts from us rather than rights. Now, it's not hard to see why this is such a commonly held worldview. It's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave, down to the bordered maps that we hang up in our schoolrooms. The problem with this worldview is that it just doesn't correspond to the way the world actually works, and the way it has worked in the past. Of course, American workers have built up wealth in society. But so have immigrants, particularly in parts of the American economy that are indispensable and where few Americans work, like agriculture. Since the nation's founding, Americans have been inside the American workforce. Of course, Americans have built up institutions in society that guarantee rights. But so have immigrants. They've been there during every major social movement, like civil rights and organized labor, that have fought to expand rights in society for everyone. So immigrants are already inside the struggle for rights, democracy and freedom. And finally, Americans and other citizens of the Global North haven't minded their own business, and they haven't stayed within their own borders. They haven't respected other nations' borders. They've gone out into the world with their armies, they've taken over territories and resources, and they've extracted enormous profits from many of the countries that immigrants are from. In this sense, many immigrants are actually already inside American power. With this different map of inside and outside in mind, the question isn't whether receiving countries are going to let immigrants in. They're already in. The question is whether the United States and other countries are going to give immigrants access to the rights and resources that their work, their activism and their home countries have already played a fundamental role in creating. With this new map in mind, we can turn to a set of tough, new, urgently needed questions, radically different from the ones we've asked before -- questions that might change the borders of the immigration debate. Our three questions are about workers' rights, about responsibility and about equality. First, we need to be asking about workers' rights. How do existing policies make it harder for immigrants to defend themselves and easier for them to be exploited, driving down wages, rights and protections for everyone? When immigrants are threatened with roundups, detention and deportations, their employers know that they can be abused, that they can be told that if they fight back, they'll be turned over to ICE. When employers know that they can terrorize an immigrant with his lack of papers, it makes that worker hyper-exploitable, and that has impacts not only for immigrant workers but for all workers. Second, we need to ask questions about responsibility. What role have rich, powerful countries like the United States played in making it hard or impossible for immigrants to stay in their home countries? Picking up and moving from your country is difficult and dangerous, but many immigrants simply do not have the option of staying home if they want to survive. Wars, trade agreements and consumer habits rooted in the Global North play a major and devastating role here. What responsibilities do the United States, the European Union and China -- the world's leading carbon emitters -- have to the millions of people already uprooted by global warming? And third, we need to ask questions about equality. Global inequality is a wrenching, intensifying problem. Income and wealth gaps are widening around the world. Increasingly, what determines whether you're rich or poor, more than anything else, is what country you're born in, which might seem great if you're from a prosperous country. But it actually means a profoundly unjust distribution of the chances for a long, healthy, fulfilling life. When immigrants send money or goods home to their family, it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps, if a very incomplete one. It does more than all of the foreign aid programs in the world combined. We began with the nativist questions, about immigrants as tools, as others and as parasites. Where might these new questions about worker rights, about responsibility and about equality take us? These questions reject pity, and they embrace justice. These questions reject the nativist and nationalist division of us versus them. They're going to help prepare us for problems that are coming and problems like global warming that are already upon us. It's not going to be easy to turn away from the questions that we've been asking towards this new set of questions. It's no small challenge to take on and broaden the borders of us. It will take wit, inventiveness and courage. The old questions have been with us for a long time, and they're not going to give way on their own, and they're not going to give way overnight. And even if we manage to change the questions, the answers are going to be complicated, and they're going to require sacrifices and tradeoffs. And in an unequal world, we're always going to have to pay attention to the question of who has the power to join the conversation and who doesn't. But the borders of the immigration debate can be moved. It's up to all of us to move them. Thank you. (Applause)"
3:21,Jacob Soboroff,Why do Americans vote on Tuesdays?,Oct 2019,"I want to tell you all about a piece of American history that is so secret, that nobody has done anything about it for 167 years, until right now. And the way that we're going to uncover this vestigial organ of America past is by asking this question: Why? As we all know -- (Laughter) we are in the middle of another presidential election, hotly contested, as you can see. (Laughter) But what you may not know is that American voter turnout ranks near the bottom of all countries in the entire world, 138th of 172 nations. This is the world's most famous democracy. So ... Why do we vote on Tuesday? Does anybody know? And as a matter of fact, Michigan and Arizona are voting today. Here's the answer: Absolutely no good reason whatsoever. (Laughter) I'm not joking. You will not find the answer in the Declaration of Independence, nor will you find it in the Constitution. It is just a stupid law from 1845. (Laughter) In 1845, Americans traveled by horse and buggy. As did I, evidently. It took a day to get to the county seat to vote, a day to get back, and you couldn't travel on the Sabbath, so, Tuesday it was. I don't often travel by horse and buggy, I would imagine most of you don't, so when I found out about this, I was fascinated. I linked up with a group called, what else -- ""Why Tuesday?"" to go and ask our nation's most prominent elected leaders if they knew the answer to the question, ""Why do we vote on Tuesday?"" (Video) Rick Santorum: Anybody knows? OK, I'm going to be stumped on this. Anybody knows why we vote on Tuesdays? Jacob Soboroff: Do you happen to know? Ron Paul: On Tuesdays? JS: The day after the first Monday in November. RP: I don't know how that originated. JS: Do you know why we do vote on Tuesday? Newt Gingrich: No. Dick Lugar: No, I don't. (Laughter) Dianne Feinstein: I don't. Darrell Issa: No. John Kerry: In truth, really, I'm not sure why. JS: OK, thanks very much. (Laughter) JS: These are people that live for election day, yet they don't know why we vote on that very day. (Laughter) Chris Rock said, ""They don't want you to vote. If they did, we wouldn't vote on a Tuesday in November. Have you ever thrown a party on a Tuesday? (Laughter) No, of course not. Nobody would show up."" (Laughter) Here's the cool part. Because we asked this question, ""Why Tuesday?"" there is now this bill, the Weekend Voting Act in the Congress of the United States of America. It would move election day from Tuesday to the weekend, so that -- duh -- more people can vote. (Applause) It has only taken 167 years, but finally, we are on the verge of changing American history. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thanks a lot. (Applause)"
14:49,Luis H. Zayas,The psychological impact of child separation at the US-Mexico border,Oct 2019,"For over 40 years, I've been a clinical social worker and a developmental psychologist. And it seemed almost natural for me to go into the helping professions. My parents had taught me to do good for others. And so I devoted my career to working with families in some of the toughest circumstances: poverty, mental illness, immigration, refugees. And for all those years, I've worked with hope and with optimism. In the past five years, though, my hope and my optimism have been put to the test. I've been so deeply disappointed in the way the United States government is treating families who are coming to our southern border, asking for asylum -- desperate parents with children, from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, who only want to bring their kids to safety and security. They are fleeing some of the worst violence in the world. They've been attacked by gangs, assaulted, raped, extorted, threatened. They have faced death. And they can't turn to their police because the police are complicit, corrupt, ineffective. Then they get to our border, and we put them in detention centers, prisons, as if they were common criminals. Back in 2014, I met some of the first children in detention centers. And I wept. I sat in my car afterwards and I cried. I was seeing some of the worst suffering I'd ever known, and it went against everything I believed in my country, the rule of law and everything my parents taught me. The way the United States has handled the immigrants seeking asylum in our country over the past five years -- it's wrong, just simply wrong. Tonight, I want to tell you that children in immigration detention are being traumatized. And we are causing the trauma. We in America -- actually, those of us here tonight -- will not necessarily be on the same page with respect to immigration. We'll disagree on how we're going to handle all those people who want to come to our country. Frankly, it doesn't matter to me whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative. I want secure borders. I also want to keep the bad actors out. I want national security. And of course, you'll have your ideas about those topics, too. But I think we can agree that America should not be doing harm. The government, the state, should not be in the business of hurting children. It should be protecting them, no matter whose children they are: your children, my grandchildren and the children of families just looking for asylum. Now, I could tell you story after story of children who have witnessed some of the worst violence in the world and are now sitting in detention. But two little boys have stayed with me over these past five years. One of them was Danny. Danny was seven and a half years old when I met him in a detention center in Karnes City, Texas, back in 2014. He was there with his mother and his brother, and they had fled Honduras. You know, Danny is one of these kids that you get to love instantly. He's funny, he's innocent, he's charming and very expressive. And he's drawing pictures for me, and one of the pictures he drew for me was of the Revos Locos. The Revos Locos: this is the name that they gave to gangs in the town that he was in. I said to Danny, ""Danny, what makes them bad guys?"" Danny looked at me with puzzlement. I mean, the look was more like, ""Are you clueless or just stupid?"" (Laughter) He leaned in and he whispered, ""Don't you see? They smoke cigarettes."" (Laughter) ""And they drink beer."" Danny had learned, of course, about the evils of drinking and smoking. Then he said, ""And they carry guns."" In one of the pictures, the stick figures of the Revos Locos are shooting at birds and at people. Danny told me about the day his uncle was killed by those Revos Locos and how he ran from his house to his uncle's farmhouse, only to see his uncle's dead body, his face disfigured by bullets. And Danny told me he saw his uncle's teeth coming out the back of his head. He was only six at the time. Sometime after that, one of those Revos Locos beat little Danny badly, severely, and that's when his parents said, ""We have got to leave or they will kill us."" So they set out. But Danny's father was a single-leg amputee with a crutch, and he couldn't manage the rugged terrain. So he said to his wife, ""Go without me. Take our boys. Save our boys."" So Mom and the boys set off. Danny told me he looked back, said goodbye to his father, looked back a couple of times until he lost sight of his father. In detention, he had not heard from his father. And it's very likely that his father was killed by the Revos Locos, because he had tried to flee. I can't forget Danny. The other boy was Fernando. Now, Fernando was in the same detention center, roughly the same age as Danny. Fernando was telling me about the 24 hours he spent in isolation with his mother in the detention center, placed there because his mother had led a hunger strike among the mothers in the detention center, and now she was cracking under the pressure of the guards, who were threatening and being very abusive towards her and Fernando. As Fernando and I are talking in the small office, his mother burst in, and she says, ""They hear you! They're listening to you."" And she dropped to her hands and knees, and she began to look under the table, groping under all the chairs. She looked at the electric sockets, at the corner of the room, the floor, the corner of the ceiling, at the lamp, at the air vent, looking for hidden microphones and cameras. I watched Fernando as he watched his mother spiral into this paranoid state. I looked in his eyes and I saw utter terror. After all, who would take care of him if she couldn't? It was just the two of them. They only had each other. I could tell you story after story, but I haven't forgotten Fernando. And I know something about what that kind of trauma, stress and adversity does to children. So I'm going to get clinical with you for a moment, and I'm going to be the professor that I am. Under prolonged and intense stress, trauma, hardship, adversity, harsh conditions, the developing brain is harmed, plain and simple. Its wiring and its architecture are damaged. The child's natural stress response system is affected. It's weakened of its protective factors. Regions of the brain that are associated with cognition, intellectual abilities, judgment, trust, self-regulation, social interaction, are weakened, sometimes permanently. That impairs children's future. We also know that under stress, the child's immune system is suppressed, making them susceptible to infections. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, will follow those children into adulthood and likely shorten their lives. Mental health problems are linked to the breakdown of the body. I have seen children in detention who have recurrent and disturbing nightmares, night terrors, depression and anxiety, dissociative reactions, hopelessness, suicidal thinking and post-traumatic stress disorders. And they regress in their behavior, like the 11-year-old boy who began to wet his bed again after years of continence. And the eight-year-old girl who was buckling under the pressure and was insisting that her mother breastfeed her. That is what detention does to children. Now, you may ask: What do we do? What should our government do? Well, I'm just a mental health professional, so all I really know is about children's health and development. But I have some ideas. First, we need to reframe our practices. We need to replace fear and hostility with safety and compassion. We need to tear down the prison walls, the barbed wire, take away the cages. Instead of prison, or prisons, we should create orderly asylum processing centers, campus-like communities where children and families can live together. We could take old motels, old army barracks, refit them so that children and parents can live as family units in some safety and normality, where kids can run around. In these processing centers, pediatricians, family doctors, dentists and nurses, would be screening, examining, treating and immunizing children, creating records that will follow them to their next medical provider. Social workers would be conducting mental health evaluations and providing treatment for those who need it. Those social workers would be connecting families to services that they're going to need, wherever they're headed. And teachers would be teaching and testing children and documenting their learning so that the teachers at the next school can continue those children's education. There's a lot more that we could do in these processing centers. A lot more. And you probably are thinking, this is pie-in-the-sky stuff. Can't blame you. Well, let me tell you that refugee camps all over the world are holding families like those in our detention centers, and some of those refugee camps are getting it right far better than we are. The United Nations has issued reports describing refugee camps that protect children's health and development. Children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together. Parents are given work permits so they can earn some money, they're given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop. Mothers are brought together to cook healthy meals for the children, and children go to school every day and are taught. Afterwards, after school, they go home and they ride bikes, hang out with friends, do homework and explore the world -- all the essentials for child development. We can get it right. We have the resources to get it right. What we need is the will and the insistence of Americans that we treat children humanely. You know, I can't forget Danny or Fernando. I wonder where they are today, and I pray that they are healthy and happy. They are only two of the many children I met and of the thousands we know about who have been in detention. I may be saddened by what's happened to the children, but I'm inspired by them. I may cry, as I did, but I admire those children's strength. They keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do. So while we may differ on our approach to immigration, we should be treating children with dignity and respect. We should do right by them. If we do, we can prepare those children who remain in the United States, prepare them to become productive, engaged members of our society. And those who will return to their countries whether voluntarily or not will be prepared to become the teachers, the merchants, the leaders in their country. And I hope together all of those children and parents could give testimony to the world about the goodness of our country and our values. But we have to get it right. So we can agree to disagree on immigration, but I hope we can agree on one thing: that none of us wants to look back at this moment in our history, when we knew we were inflicting lifelong trauma on children, and that we sat back and did nothing. That would be the greatest tragedy of all. Thank you. (Applause)"
10:15,Juan Enriquez,A personal plea for humanity at the US-Mexico border,Oct 2019,"This one's personal. I know what it's like to have the government say, ""We're going to kill you in the morning."" I know what it's like to leave a country on six hours' notice and land on someone's couch. Because of that, I wrote a book on why countries do well and why they don't. Let me summarize 250 pages. Countries have to be compassionate, they have to be kind, they have to be smart, they have to be brave. Want to know what doesn't work? When you govern through fear and you govern through cruelty, it just doesn't work. You can play Genghis Khan for a while, you can play Stalin for a while, you can play Pinochet for a while. It does not work in the long run. And it doesn't work in the long run because to govern through fear and cruelty, you have to create a division. You have to take big chunks of the country and convince them that they're not like them. That they shouldn't associate with them, they shouldn't talk to them. That those people are nasty, those people are criminals, those people are rapists. And the country is in danger because of them. And if you spend millions of dollars doing that in your country, you will make enemies abroad, and you will create divisions within. And that has consequences. Three quarters of the flags and the borders and the anthems around the United Nations today, they were not there a few decades ago. Those lines that are there today, those flags were created because somebody said, ""the Scotts are not like us,"" ""the Welsh are not like us,"" ""the Basques are not like us,"" ""the northern Italians are not like us,"" ""the Muslims are not like us,"" the blacks, the whites, the Christians. You create ""us versus them"" ... you destroy nations. Part of the problem from creating us versus them is it's hard to do. What you have to do is you have to make people believe absurdities. And once people believe absurdities, then they start to commit atrocities. That's the dynamic of this thing. You can't create ""us versus them"" -- you can't have the massacres you had in Rwanda, you can't have the massacres you had in Yugoslavia -- unless if you create this dynamic. Let me summarize current immigration policy. Let's deter ""Them"" by being as cruel as we can possibly be, and let's target their children. They are going after the children. You have US lawyers arguing that kids do not need soap or hugs or showers, adult help or a release date. Somebody gets pulled over for a broken tail light, who's worked here for 20 years, gets thrown into jail, maybe for life, with no legal representation. The terrorists that blew up the World Trade Center get lawyers. These kids, these parents, they don't get lawyers. Governments are telling some of the most desperate, hurt people on earth, ""I took your child, pay me 800 dollars for a DNA test before you get it back."" Three-year-olds are appearing in court. Look, we've all watched these courtroom dramas. And it's exciting, because the wise judge sits up there, and the defense lawyer attacks and the prosecutor counterattacks, and then you figure out how it's going to happen. I want you to understand what is happening right now. Prosecutor's there -- it's the tough prosecutor. Accusing, attacking, on behalf of we the people. The judge is up there, Judge Muckety-muck, with his black robes, and he's questioning the defendant from up there. And the defendant is three years old and the eyes don't reach the side of the table. The defendant does not speak the language. The earphones for the translator have fallen off the defendant's head, because there are no headphones for three-year-olds in US courtrooms, because they are not supposed to defend themselves. This makes a mockery of justice, it makes a mockery of the prosecution system, it makes a mockery of who we are as a nation. These are absurdities. These are atrocities. This is unbelievable. And we're looking at a bunch of statistics, but I want you to understand, this is happening to the housekeeper who brought up your kids. This is happening to the gardener who took care of your house. This is happening to the guy who washed the dishes in the fancy restaurant you went to last week. This is happening to the people who deliver the newspaper in the mornings. This is your community, these are the people who have lived side by side with you. Treated you well, treated you with respect, taken care of your kids, taken care of your grandparents. This is Luis, this is Laura, this is Jaime. This isn't some abstract, ""Oh, it's happening at the border"" -- this is happening in our community, right now. And the danger in this stuff is once you start normalizing absurdities and atrocities, people think that those instruments are legitimate. So you get school boards sending out letters like this: ""Dear Parent, because your kid owes lunch money to the cafeteria, the result may be that your child will be taken away and put in foster care."" This is going out from school boards because people think, ""Well, that seems to be an instrument of deterrence."" When you board an airplane, before kids, before first class, soldiers in uniform board. Some of them are immigrants. Here's a contract: join the army, serve your term, be honorably discharged, get citizenship. We are rescinding those contracts after they have been signed. And if those soldiers are killed in action, we are deporting their wives, and sometimes, their children. These are the people who protect us. These are the people that we honor. These are the brave. And this is how we're treating them. These are not the people who cross the border illegally. Once you start allowing this kind of behavior, it normalizes into a society, and it rips the society apart. Countries are built on the hard work and grit of immigrants; we are all immigrants. We just came at different times. Fifty-five percent of this country's main businesses, the most successful businesses in this country, the unicorns, are built by people who came as foreign students or as immigrants, and they're the founders or the cofounders. Well, here's what's happened over the last three years to the best brains in the world. Forty-two percent of them did not get visas or chose not to get visas. This is how you wipe out an economy. This isn't about kids and borders. It's about us. This is about who we are, who we the people are, as a nation and as individuals. This is not an abstract debate. A lot of us like to think if we had been back when Hitler was rising to power, we would have been out in the street, we would have opposed him, we would have stopped Mengele. A lot of us like to think, if we had been around during the '60s, we would have been with the Freedom Riders. We would have been at that bridge in Selma. Well, guess what? Here's your chance. It's now. And as you're thinking about this stuff, it's not just the giant acts, it's not just go and block the bridge or chain yourself to something. It's what you do in your daily lives. The Harvard Art Museum just opened a show on how artists think about immigration and building a home somewhere else. And people come out of that show and they're pretty shaken. There was a blank wall at the end. And the curators did something that usually doesn't happen -- they improvised. They drew four lines, and put in two words: ""I belong."" So you come out of this exhibit, and you can take a picture in front of it. I can't tell you the impact that has on people -- I watched people come out of this, and some of them sat in front of that picture, took a picture, and they had a great, big grin on their face, and some people just had tears. Some people hugged and brought in strangers, others brought in their family. Small acts of kindness go a long, long, long way. There is pain going on in your community like you cannot believe. So next time you're with a cab driver who may be one of ""Them,"" according to certain people, give that person an extra five bucks. Next time you see a hotel maid, thank her and tip her double. Next time you see your gardener, you see your nanny, you see somebody like this, give them a great, big hug, and tell them they belong. Make them feel like they belong. It's time for big policies, but it's also time for big acts of kindness. Because we have to reclaim who we are, we have to reclaim this nation. (Voice breaking) And we cannot sit there and watch this shit going on. This has got to stop, it's got to stop now. Thank you. (Applause)"
16:00,Mitchell Katz,What the US health care system assumes about you,Oct 2019,"A few years ago, I was taking care of a woman who was a victim of violence. I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors. I made the appointment myself because, being the director of the department, I knew if I did it, she would get an appointment right away. The clinic was about an hour and a half away from where she lived. But she took down the address and agreed to go. Unfortunately, she didn't make it to the clinic. When I spoke to the psychiatrist, he explained to me that trauma survivors are often resistant to dealing with the difficult issues that they face and often miss appointments. For this reason, they don't generally allow the doctors to make appointments for the patients. They had made a special exception for me. When I spoke to my patient, she had a much simpler and less Freudian explanation of why she didn't go to that appointment: her ride didn't show. Now, some of you may be thinking, ""Didn't she have some other way of getting to that clinic appointment?"" Couldn't she have taken an Uber or called another friend? If you're thinking that, it's probably because you have resources. But she didn't have enough money for an Uber, and she didn't have another friend to call. But she did have me, and I was able to get her another appointment, which she kept without difficulty. She wasn't resistant, it's just that her ride didn't show. I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident, but I know from running the safety net systems in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now New York City, that health care is built on a middle-class model that often doesn't meet the needs of low-income patients. That's one of the reasons why it's been so difficult for us to close the disparity in health care that exists along economic lines, despite the expansion of health insurance under the ACA, or Obamacare. Health care in the United States assumes that, besides getting across the large land expanse of Los Angeles, it also assumes that you can take off from work in the middle of the day to get care. One of the patients who came to my East Los Angeles clinic on a Thursday afternoon presented with partial blindness in both eyes. Very concerned, I said to him, ""When did this develop?"" He said, ""Sunday."" I said, ""Sunday? Did you think of coming sooner to clinic?"" And he said, ""Well, I have to work in order to pay the rent."" A second patient to that same clinic, a trucker, drove three days with a raging infection, only coming to see me after he had delivered his merchandise. Both patients' care was jeopardized by their delays in seeking care. Health care in the United States assumes that you speak English or can bring someone with you who can. In San Francisco, I took care of a patient on the inpatient service who was from West Africa and spoke a dialect so unusual that we could only find one translator on the telephonic line who could understand him. And that translator only worked one afternoon a week. Unfortunately, my patient needed translation services every day. Health care in the United States assumes that you are literate. I learned that a patient of mine who spoke English without accent was illiterate, when he asked me to please sign a social security disability form for him right away. The form needed to go to the office that same day, and I wasn't in clinic, so trying to help him out, knowing that he was the sole caretaker of his son, I said, ""Well, bring the form to my administrative office. I'll sign it and I'll fax it in for you."" He took the two buses to my office, dropped off the form, went back home to take care of his son ... I got to the office, and what did I find next to the big ""X"" on the form? The word ""applicant."" He needed to sign the form. And so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him. It completely changed how I took care of him. I made sure that I always went over instructions verbally with him. It also made me think about all of the patients who receive reams and reams of paper spit out by our modern electronic health record systems, explaining their diagnoses and their treatments, and wondering how many people actually can understand what's on those pieces of paper. Health care in the United States assumes that you have a working telephone and an accurate address. The proliferation of inexpensive cell phones has actually helped quite a lot. But still, my patients run out of minutes, and their phones get disconnected. Low-income people often have to move around a lot by necessity. I remember reviewing a chart of a woman with an abnormality on her mammogram. That chart assiduously documents that three letters were sent to her home, asking her to please come in for follow-up. Of course, if the address isn't accurate, it doesn't much matter how many letters you send to that same address. Health care in the United States assumes that you have a steady supply of food. This is particularly an issue for diabetics. We give them medications that lower their blood sugar. On days when they don't have enough food, it puts them at risk for a life-threatening side effect of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Health care in the United States assumes that you have a home with a refrigerator for your insulin, a bathroom where you can wash up, a bed where you can sleep without worrying about violence while you're resting. But what if you don't have that? What if you live on the street, you live under the freeway, you live in a congregant shelter, where every morning you have to leave at 7 or 8am? Where do you store your medicines? Where do you use the bathroom? How do you put your legs up if you have congestive heart failure? Is it any wonder that providing people with health insurance who are homeless does not erase the huge disparity between the homeless and the housed? Health care in the United States assumes that you prioritize your health care. But what about all of you? Let me assume for a moment that you're all taking a medication. Maybe it's for high blood pressure. Maybe it's for diabetes or depression. What if tonight you had a choice: you could have your medication but live on the street, or you could be housed in your home but not have your medication. Which would you choose? I know which one I would choose. This is just a graphic example of the kinds of choices that low-income patients have to make every day. So when my doctors shake their heads and say, ""I don't know why that patient didn't keep his follow-up appointments,"" ""I don't know why she didn't go for that exam that I ordered,"" I think, well, maybe her ride didn't show, or maybe he had to work. But also, maybe there was something more important that day than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy. Maybe that patient was dealing with an abusive spouse or a daughter who is pregnant and drug-addicted or a son who was kicked out of school. Or even maybe they were riding their bicycle through an intersection and got hit by a truck, and now they're using a wheelchair and have very limited mobility. Obviously, these things also happen to middle-class people. But when they do, we have resources that enable us to deal with these problems. We also have the belief that we will live out our normal lifespans. That's not true for low-income people. They've seen their friends and relatives die young of accidents, of violence, of cancers that should have been diagnosed at an earlier stage. It can lead to a sense of hopelessness, that it doesn't really matter what you do. I know I've painted a bleak picture of the care of low-income patients. But I want you to know how rewarding I find it to work in a safety net system, and my deep belief is that we can make the system responsive to the needs of low-income patients. The starting point has to be to meet patients where they are, provide services without obstacles and provide patients what they need -- not what we think they need. It's impossible for me to take good care of a patient who is homeless and living on the street. The right prescription for a homeless patient is housing. In Los Angeles, we housed 4,700 chronically homeless persons suffering from medical illness, mental illness, addiction. When we housed them, we found that overall health care costs, including the housing, decreased. That's because they had many fewer hospital visits, both in the emergency room and on the inpatient service. And we gave them back their dignity. No extra charge for that. For people who do not have a steady supply of food, especially those who are diabetic, safety net systems are experimenting with a variety of solutions, including food pantries at primary care clinics and distributing maps of community food banks and soup kitchens. And in New York City, we've hired a bunch of enrollers to get our patients into the supplemental nutrition program known as ""food stamps"" to most people. When patients and doctors don't understand each other, mistakes will occur. For non-English-speaking patients, translation is as important as a prescription pad. Perhaps more important. And, you know, it doesn't cost anything more to put all of the materials at the level of fourth-grade reading, so that everybody can understand what's being said. But more than anything else, I think low-income patients benefit from having a primary care doctor. Mind you, I think middle-class people also benefit from having somebody to quarterback their care. But when they don't, they have others who can advocate for them, who can get them that disability placard or make sure the disability application is completed. But low-income people really need a team of people who can help them to access the medical and non-medical services that they need. Also, many low-income people are disenfranchised from other community supports, and they really benefit from the care and continuity provided by primary care. A primary care doctor I particularly admire once told me how she believed that her relationship with a patient over a decade was the only healthy relationship that that patient had in her life. The good news is, you don't actually have to be a doctor to provide that special sauce of care and continuity. This was really brought home to me when one of my own long-term patients died at an outside hospital. I had to tell the other doctors and nurses in my clinic that he had passed. But I didn't know that in another part of our clinic, on a different floor, there was a registration clerk who had developed a very special relationship with my patient every time he came in for an appointment. When she learned three weeks later that he had died, she came and found me in my examining room, tears streaming down her cheeks, talking about my patient and the memories that she had of him, the kinds of discussions that they had had about their lives together. My patient had a hard life. He was by his own admission a gangbanger. He had spent a substantial amount of time in prison. He suffered from a very serious illness. He was a drug addict. But despite all that, he rarely missed a visit, and I like to believe that was because he knew at our clinic that he was loved. When our health care systems have the same commitment to low-income patients that that man had to us, two things will happen. First, the system will be responsive to the needs of low-income people. It will speak their language, it will meet their schedules, it will fulfill their needs. Second, we will be providing the kind of care that we went into this profession to do -- not just checking the boxes, but really taking care of those we serve. Thank you. (Applause)"
5:27,Densho,Ugly History: Japanese American incarceration camps,Oct 2019,"On December 7, 1941, 16 year-old Aki Kurose shared in the  horror of millions of Americans when Japanese planes  attacked Pearl Harbor. What she did not know, was how that shared experience would soon leave her family and  over 120,000 Japanese Americans alienated from their country, both socially and physically. As of 1941, Japanese American communities had been growing in the US for over 50 years. About one-third of them were immigrants, many of whom settled on the West Coast  and had lived there for decades. The rest were born as American citizens,  like Aki. Born Akiko Kato in Seattle, Aki grew up in a diverse neighborhood where she never thought of herself as anything but American– until the day after the attack, when a  teacher told her: “You people bombed Pearl Harbor."" Amid racism, paranoia,  and fears of sabotage, people labelled Japanese Americans  as potential traitors. FBI agents began to search homes,  confiscate belongings and detain community leaders  without trial. Aki’s family was not immediately subjected to these extreme measures, but on February 19, 1942, President  Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. The order authorized the removal of any  suspected enemies– including anyone of even  partial Japanese heritage– from designated ‘military areas.’ At first, Japanese Americans were pushed to leave restricted areas and migrate inland. But as the government froze  their bank accounts and imposed local restrictions  such as curfews, many were unable to leave–  Aki’s family among them. In March, a proclamation forbid Japanese  Americans from changing their residency, trapping them in military zones.  In May, the army moved Aki and her family, along with over 7,000 Japanese Americans living in Seattle to ""Camp Harmony"" in Puyallup, Washington. This was one of several makeshift  detention centers at former fairgrounds and racetracks, where entire families were packed into  poorly converted stables and barracks. Over the ensuing months, the army moved Japanese Americans  into long-term camps in desolate areas of the West and South, moving Aki and her family to  Minidoka in southern Idaho. Guarded by armed soldiers, many of these camps were still being  constructed when incarcerees moved in. These hastily built prisons were  overcrowded and unsanitary. People frequently fell ill and were unable to receive proper medical care. The War Relocation Authority relied on  incarcerees to keep the camps running. Many worked in camp facilities or taught  in poorly equipped classrooms, while others raised crops and animals. Some Japanese Americans rebelled,  organizing labor strikes and even rioting. But many more,  like Aki’s parents, endured. They constantly sought to recreate some  semblance of life outside the camps, but the reality of their  situation was unavoidable. Like many younger incarcerees,  Aki was determined to leave her camp. She finished her final year  of high school at Minidoka, and with the aid of an anti-racist Quaker  organization, she was able to enroll at  Friends University in Kansas. For Aki’s family however, things wouldn’t  begin to change until late 1944. A landmark Supreme Court case ruled that continued detention of American citizens without charges was unconstitutional. In the fall of 1945, the war ended and the camps closed down. Remaining incarcerees  were given a mere $25 and a train ticket to their  pre-war address, but many no longer had a home  or job to return to. Aki’s family had been able to  keep their apartment, and Aki eventually returned  to Seattle after college. However, post-war prejudice  made finding work difficult. Incarcarees faced discrimination  and resentment from workers and tenants  who replaced them. Fortunately, Japanese Americans  weren’t alone in the fight against  racial discrimination. Aki found work with one of Seattle’s first interracial labor unions and joined the Congress  of Racial Equality. She became a teacher, and over the next several decades, her advocacy for multicultural, socially  conscious education would impact thousands of students. However, many ex-incarcerees,  particularly members of older generations, were unable to rebuild  their lives after the war. Children of incarcerees began a movement calling for the United States to atone  for this historic injustice. In 1988, the US government officially  apologized for the wartime incarceration– admitting it was the catastrophic result  of racism, hysteria, and failed political leadership. Three years after this apology, Aki Kurose was awarded the  Human Rights Award from the Seattle Chapter  of the United Nations, celebrating her vision of peace and  respect for people of all backgrounds."
17:23,Will Hurd,A wall won't solve America's border problems,Sep 2019,"Anne Milgram: Congressman, I was about to introduce you and say a little more -- Will Hurd: Hey, Anne. How are you? AM: Hi, how are you doing? Thank you so much for joining us tonight. We're so lucky to have you here with us. I've already explained that you're actually in Washington because you're working. And I was about to tell folks that you represent the 23rd district of Texas. But maybe you could tell us a little bit about your district and describe it for us. WH: Sure, my district in Southwest Texas is 29 counties, two time zones, 820 miles of border from Eagle Pass, Texas all the way to El Paso. It takes 10 and a half hours to drive across my district at 80 miles an hour, which is the speed limit in most of the district. And I found out a couple of weekends ago, it's not the speed limit in all the district. (Laughter) It's a 71-percent Latino district, and it's the district that I've been representing for now my third term in Congress. And when you think about the issue of the border, I have more border than any other member of Congress. I spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, chasing bad people all across the country. So when it comes to securing our border, it's something I know a little bit about. AM: One of the things I learned recently which I hadn't known before is that your district is actually the size, I think, of the state of Georgia? WH: That's right. It's larger than 26 states, roughly the size of the state of Georgia. So it's pretty big. AM: So as an expert in national security and as a member of Congress, you've been called upon to think about issues related to immigration, and in recent years, particularly about the border wall. What is your reaction to President Trump's statement that we need a big, beautiful wall that would stretch across our border, and at 18 to 30 feet high? WH: I've been saying this since I first ran for Congress back in 2009, this is not a new topic, that building a 30-foot-high concrete structure from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security. There are parts of the border where Border Patrol's response time to a threat is measured in hours to days. If your response time is measured in hours to days, then a wall is not a physical barrier. We should be having technology along the border, we should have operation control of our border, which means we know everything that's going back and forth across it. We can do a lot of that with technology. We also need more folks within our border patrol. But in addition to doing all this, one of the things we should be able to do is streamline legal immigration. If you're going to be a productive member of our society, let's get you here as quickly as possible, but let's do it legally. And if we're able to streamline that, then you're going to see some of the pressures relieved along our border and allow men and women in Border Patrol to focus on human trafficking and drug-trafficking organizations as well. AM: Congressman, there's also been a conversation nationally about using emergency funds to build the border wall and taking those funds from the United States military. What has your position been on that issue? WH: I'm one of the few Republicans up here that has opposed that effort. We are just now rebuilding our military, and taking funds away from making sure that our brothers and sisters, our wives and our husbands have the training and equipment they need in order to take care of us in far-flung places -- taking money away from them is not an efficient use of our resources, especially if it's going to build a ... you know, I always say it's a fourth-century solution to a 21st-century problem. And the reality is, what we should be focusing on is some of the other root causes of this problem, and many of your speakers today have talked about that. Some of those key root problems are violence, lack of economic opportunity and extreme poverty, specifically, in the Northern Triangle: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. We should be working -- AM: I was going to ask what you would recommend United States government does to address the underlying, what we call push factors, or root causes in those three countries in Central America? WH: One of the things I learned as an undercover officer in the CIA is be nice with nice guys and tough with tough guys. And one of the principles of being nice with nice guys is to strengthen our alliances. We have a number of programs currently in these three countries that USAID and the State Department is doing to address this violence issue. And we know, in El Salvador, one of the problems was that the police were corrupt. And so we've worked with the Salvadorians to purge the police, rehire new folks, use community policing tactics. These are tactics the men and women in the United States of America and police forces use every single day. And when we did this in certain communities, guess what happened? We saw a decrease in the violence that was happening in those communities. And then we also saw a decrease in the number of people that were leaving those areas to try to come to the United States illegally. So it's a fraction of the cost to solve a problem there, before it ultimately reaches our border. And one of the reasons that you have violence and crime is political corruption and the lack of central governments to protect its citizens. And so this is something we should be continuing to work on. We shouldn't be decreasing the amount of money that we have that we're sending to these countries. I actually think we should be increasing it. I believe the first thing -- we should have done this months ago -- is select a special representative for the Northern Triangle. That's a senior diplomat that's going to work to make sure we're using all of our levers of power to help these three countries, and then that we're doing it in a coordinated effort. This is not just a problem for the United States and Mexico, this is a problem for the entire western hemisphere. So, where is the Organization of American States? Where is the International Development Bank? We should be having a collective plan to address these root causes. And when you talk about violence, a lot of times, we talk about these terrible gangs like MS-13. But it's also violence like women being beaten by their husbands. And they have nobody else to go to, and they are unable to deal with this current problem. So these are the types of issues that we should be increasing our diplomacy, increasing our economic development aid. AM: Please, I want to take you now from thinking about the root causes in Central America to thinking about the separation of children and families in the United States. Starting in April 2018, the Trump administration began a no-tolerance policy for immigrants, people seeking refugee status, asylum in the United States. And that led to the separation of 2,700 children in the first year that that program was run. Now, I want to address this with you, and I want to separate it up front into two different conversations. One of the things that the administration did was file legal court papers, saying that one of the primary purposes of the separations was to act as a deterrent against people coming to the United States. And I want to talk for a moment about that from a moral perspective and to get your views. WH: We shouldn't be doing it, period. It's real simple. And guess what, it wasn't a deterrent. You only saw an increase in the amount of illegal immigration. And when you're sitting, debating a strategy, if somebody comes up with the idea of snatching a child out of their mother's arms, you need to go back to the drawing board. This is not what the United States of America stands for, this is not a Republican or a Democrat or independent thing. This is a human decency thing. And so, using that strategy, it didn't achieve the ultimate purpose. And ultimately, the amount of research that is done and the impact that the detention of children has -- especially if it's over 21 days -- has on their development and their future is disastrous. So we shouldn't be trying to detain children for any more than 21 days, and we should be getting children, if they're in our custody, we should be taking care of them humanely, and making sure they're with people that can provide them a safe and loving environment. AM: I would challenge you even on the 21-day number, but for the purposes of this conversation, I want to follow up on something you just said, which is both that it's wrong to detain children, and that it's not effective. So the question, then, is why does the administration continue to do it, when we've seen 900 additional children separated from their parents since the summer of 2018? Why is this happening? WH: Well, that's something that you'd have to ultimately ask the administration. These are questions that I've been asking. The Tornillo facility is in my district. These are buildings that are not designed to hold anybody for multiple days, let alone children. We should be making sure that if they are in our custody -- a lot of times for the uncompanied children, we don't have a ... we don't know of a patron or a family member in the United States, and we should make sure that they're in facilities where they're able to go to school and have proper food and health care. And if we're able to find a sponsor or family member, let's get them into that custody, while they're waiting for their immigration court case. That's the other issue here. When you have a backlog of cases -- I think it's now 900,000 cases that are backlogged -- we should be able to do an immigration hearing within nine months. I think most of the legal community thinks that is enough time to do something like this, so that we can facilitate whether someone, an individual, is able to stay in the United States or they're going to have to be returned back to their home country, rather than being in this limbo for five years. AM: If we think about the asylum system today, where people are coming and saying that they have a credible threat, that they will be persecuted back home, and we think about the fact that on average, it's about two years for someone to get an asylum hearing, that many people are not represented as they go through that process, it makes me think about something that they say in the health care space all the time, which is that every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. And so as you think about this and think about how we would redesign this system to not do what we're doing, which is years and years of detention and separations and hardship for people seeking -- and again, asylum being a lawful United States government process -- for people seeking to enter our country lawfully. What should we do? WH: I tried to increase by four billion dollars the amount of resources that HHS has in order to specifically deal, ultimately, with children. I think we need more immigration judges in order to process these cases, and I think we need to ensure that folks can get representation. I've been able to work with a number of lawyers up and down the border to make sure they are being able to get access to the folks that are having these problems. And so this is something that we should be able to design. And ultimately, when it comes to children, we should be doing everything we can when they're in our custody, in order to take care of them. AM: So I have two more questions for you before I'm going to let you go back to work. The first is about our focus in the United States on the questions of immigration. Because if you look at some of the statistics, you see that of people who are undocumented in the United States, the majority of people have overstayed on visas, they haven't come through the border. If you look at the people who try to enter the country who are on the terrorist watch list, they enter overwhelmingly through the airports and not through the border. If we look at drugs coming into the United States, which has been a huge part of this conversation, the vast majority of those drugs come through our ports and through other points of entry, not through backpacks on people crossing the border. So the thing I always ask and I always worry about with government, is that we focus so much on one thing, and my question for you is whether we are focused in this conversation nationally about the border, every day and every minute of every day, whether we're looking completely in the wrong direction. WH: I would agree with your premise. When you have -- let's start with the economic benefits. When you have 3.6 percent unemployment, what does that mean? That means you need folks in every industry, whether it's agriculture or artificial intelligence. So why aren't we streamlining legal immigration? We should be able to make this market based in order to have folks come in and be productive members of our society. When it comes to the drug issue you're talking about, yes, it's in our ports of entry, but it's also coming in to our shores. Coast Guard is only able to action 25 percent of the known intelligence they have on drugs coming into our country. The metric that we should be measuring [is] are we seeing a decrease of deaths from overdose from drugs overseas, are we seeing a decrease in illegal immigration? It's not how many miles of fencing that we have ultimately built. And so we have benefited from the brain drain of every other country for the last couple of decades. I want to see that continue, and I want to see that continue with the hardworking drain. And I can sell you this: at last Congress, Pete Aguilar, a Democrat from California, and I had a piece of legislation called the USA Act: strong border security, streamline legal immigration, fix DACA -- 1.2 million kids who have only known the United States of America as their home -- these kids, or I should say young men and women, they are already Americans, let's not have them go through any more uncertainty and make that ultimately happen. We had 245 people that were willing to sign this bill into law, it wasn't allowed to come forward under a Republican speaker, and also the current Democratic speaker hasn't brought this bill through in something that we would be able to pass. AM: So I want to close, and you are, perhaps, most famous -- I don't know if that's fair -- but you took a road trip with Beto O'Rourke from your district to Washington, DC, and you've become known for reaching across the aisle and engaging in these bipartisan conversations. And one of the things I've seen you say repeatedly is to talk about how we are all united. And I think, when we think about the language of immigration and we start hearing words about enemies and militarization, I think the real question is: How do we convince all Americans to understand what you say that more unites us than divides us? WH: Crisscrossing a district like mine that's truly 50-50 -- 50 percent Democrat, 50 percent Republican, it's been very clear to me that way more unites us than divides us. And if we focus on those things that we agree on, we'll all be better off. And I'm not going to get a perfect attendance award for going to church, but I do remember when Jesus was in the Second Temple and the Pharisees asked him what's the most important commandment, and he said to ""Love thy Lord God with all your heart, mind and soul."" But people forget he also said, ""Equally as important, is to love thy neighbor like thyself."" And if we remember that and realize what it would mean, and what you would have to be going through to be living in a situation that you may send your child on a 3,000-mile perilous journey, because that's what you think the only thing for their future, the only thing that you can do to make sure their future is bright, if we all remember that situation, and think what we would do in that situation, I think we'd also be better off. AM: Thank you, Congressman. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. (Applause)"
12:13,Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff,How we can make racism a solvable problem — and improve policing,Sep 2019,"When people meet me for the first time on my job, they often feel inspired to share a revelation they've had about me, and it kind of goes something like this. ""Hey, I know why police chiefs like to share their deep, dark secrets with you. Phil, with your PhD in psychology, and your shiny bald head, you're basically the Black Dr. Phil, right?"" (Laughter) And for each and every person who's ever said that to me I do want to say thank you because that was the first time I ever heard that joke. (Laughter) But for everybody else, I really hope you'll believe me when I tell you no police chief likes talking to me because they think I'm a clinical psychologist. And also I'm not. I have no idea what your mother did to you, and I can't help. (Laughter) Police chiefs like talking to me because I'm an expert on a problem that feels impossible for them to solve: racism in their profession. Now my expertise comes from being a scientist who studies how our minds learn to associate Blackness and crime and misperceive Black children as older than they actually are. It also comes from studying actual police behavior, which is how I know that every year, about one in five adults in the United States has contact with law enforcement. Out of those, about a million are targeted for police use of force. And if you're Black, you're two to four times more likely to be targeted for that force than if you're white. But it also comes from knowing what those statistics feel like. I've experienced the fear of seeing an officer unclip their gun and the panic of realizing that someone might mistake my 13-year-old godson as old enough to be a threat. So when a police chief, or a pastor, or an imam, or a mother -- when they call me after an officer shoots another unarmed Black child, I understand a bit of the pain in their voice. It's the pain of a heart breaking when it fails to solve a deadly problem. Breaking from trying to do something that feels simultaneously necessary and impossible. The way trying to fix racism usually feels. Necessary and impossible. So, police chiefs like talking to me because I'm an expert, but I doubt they'd be lining up to lie down on Dr. Phil's couch if I told them all their problems were hopeless. All of my research, and the decade of work I've done with my center -- the Center for Policing Equity -- actually leads me to a hopeful conclusion amidst all the heartbreak of race in America, which is this: trying to solve racism feels impossible because our definition of racism makes it impossible -- but it doesn't have to be that way. So here's what I mean. The most common definition of racism is that racist behaviors are the product of contaminated hearts and minds. When you listen to the way we talk about trying to cure racism, you'll hear it. ""We need to stamp out hatred. We need to combat ignorance,"" right? It's hearts and minds. Now the only problem with that definition is that it's completely wrong -- both scientifically and otherwise. One of the foundational insights of social psychology is that attitudes are very weak predictors of behaviors, but more importantly than that, no Black community has ever taken to the streets to demand that white people would love us more. Communities march to stop the killing, because racism is about behaviors, not feelings. And even when civil rights leaders like King and Fannie Lou Hamer used the language of love, the racism they fought, that was segregation and brutality. It's actions over feelings. And every one of those leaders would agree, if a definition of racism makes it harder to see the injuries racism causes, that's not just wrong. A definition that cares about the intentions of abusers more than the harms to the abused -- that definition of racism is racist. But when we change the definition of racism from attitudes to behaviors, we transform that problem from impossible to solvable. Because you can measure behaviors. And when you can measure a problem, you can tap into one of the only universal rules of organizational success. You've got a problem or a goal, you measure it, you hold yourself accountable to that metric. So if every other organization measures success this way, why can't we do that in policing? It turns out we actually already do. Police departments already practice data-driven accountability, it's just for crime. The vast majority of police departments across the United States use a system called CompStat. It's a process that, when you use it right, it identifies crime data, it tracks it and identifies patterns, and then it allows departments to hold themselves accountable to public safety goals. It usually works either by directing police attentions and police resources, or changing police behavior once they show up. So if I see a string of muggings in that neighborhood, I'm going to want to increase patrols in that neighborhood. If I see a spike in homicides, I'm going to want to talk to the community to find out why and collaborate on changes on police behavior to tamp down the violence. Now when you define racism in terms of measurable behaviors, you can do the same thing. You can create a CompStat for justice. That's exactly what the Center for Policing Equity has been doing. So let me tell you how that works. After a police department invites us in, we handle the legal stuff, we engage with the community, our next step is to analyze their data. The goal of these analyses is to determine how much do crime, poverty, neighborhood demographics predict, let's say, police use of force? Let's say that those factors predict police will use force on this many Black people. There? So our next question is, how many Black people actually are targeted for police use of force? Let's say it's this many. So what's up with the gap? Well, a big portion of the gap is the difference between what's predicted by things police can't control and what's predicted by things police can control -- their policies and their behaviors. And what we're looking for are the types of contact or the areas in the city where that gap is biggest, because then we can tell our partners, ""Look here. Solve this problem first."" It's actually the kind of therapy police chiefs can get behind, because there is nothing so inspiring in the face of our history of racism as a solvable problem. Look, if the community in Minneapolis asked their police department to remedy the moral failings of race in policing, I'm not sure they know how to do that. But if instead the community says, ""Hey, you're data say you're beating up a lot of homeless folks. You want to knock that off?"" That's something police can learn how to do. And they did. So in 2015, the Minneapolis PD let us know their community was concerned they were using force too often. So we showed them how to leverage their own data to identify situations where force could be avoided. And when you look at those data, you'll see that a disproportionate number of their use-of-force incidents, they involved somebody who's homeless, in mental distress, has a substance abuse issue or some combination of all three -- more than you expect based on those factors I was just telling you about. So right there's the gap. Next question is why. Well, it turns out homeless folks often need services. And when those services are unavailable, when they can't get their meds, they lose their spot in the shelter, they're more likely to engage in behaviors that end up with folks calling the cops. And when the cops show up, they're more likely to resist intervention, oftentimes because they haven't actually done anything illegal, they're literally just living outside. The problem wasn't a need to train officers differently in Minneapolis. The problem was the fact that folks were using the cops to ""treat"" substance abuse and homelessness in the first place. So the city of Minneapolis found a way to deliver social services and city resources to the homeless community before anybody ever called the cops. (Applause) Now the problem isn't always homelessness, right? Sometimes the problem is fear of immigration enforcement, like it was in Salt Lake City, or it is in Houston, where the chiefs had to come forward and say, ""We're not going to deport you just for calling 911."" Or the problem is foot pursuits, like it was in Las Vegas, where they had to train their officers to slow down and take a breath instead of allowing the adrenaline in that situation to escalate it. It's searches in Oakland; it's pulling folks out of cars in San Jose; it's the way that they patrol the neighborhoods that make up Zone 3 in Pittsburgh and the Black neighborhoods closest to the waterfront in Baltimore. But in each city, if we can give them a solvable problem, they get busy solving it. And together our partners have seen an average of 25 percent fewer arrests, fewer use-of-force incidents and 13 percent fewer officer-related injuries. Essentially, by identifying the biggest gaps and directing police attentions to solving it, we can deliver a data-driven vaccine against racial disparities in policing. Right now, we have the capacity to partner with about 40 cities at a time. That means if we want the United States to stop feeling exhausted from trying to solve an impossible problem, we're going to need a lot more infrastructure. Because our goal is to have our tools be able to scale the brilliance of dedicated organizers and reform-minded chiefs. So to get there we're going to need the kind of collective will that desegregated schools and won the franchise for the sons and daughters of former slaves so that we can build a kind of health care system capable of delivering our vaccine across the country. Because our audacious idea is to deliver a CompStat for justice to departments serving 100 million people across the United States in the next five years. (Applause and cheers) Doing that would mean arming about a third of the United States with tools to reduce racial disparities in police stops, arrests and use of force, but also tools to reduce predatory cash bail and mass incarceration, family instability and chronic mental health and substance abuse issues, and every other ill that our broken criminal-legal systems aggravate. Because every unnecessary arrest we can prevent saves a family from the terrifying journey through each one of those systems. Just like every gun we can leave holstered saves an entire community from a lifetime of grief. Look, each and every one of us, we measure the things that matter to us. Businesses measure profit; good students keep track of their grades; families chart the growth of their children with pencil markings in doorframes. We all measure the things that matter most to us, which is why we feel the neglect when nobody's bothering to measure anything at all. For the past quarter millennium, we've defined the problems of race and policing in a way that's functionally impossible to measure. But now the science says we can just change that definition. And the folks at the Center for Policing Equity, I actually think we may have measured more police behavior than any one in human history. And that means that once we have the will and the resources to do it, this could be the generation that stops feeling like racism is an unsolvable problem and instead sees that what's been necessary for far too long is possible. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"
17:53,Kishore Mahbubani,How the West can adapt to a rising Asia,Aug 2019,"About 200 years ago, Napoleon famously warned ... He said, ""Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world."" Despite this early warning, the West chose to go to sleep at precisely the moment when China and India and the rest of Asia woke up. Why did this happen? I'm here to address this great mystery. Now what do I mean when I say the West chose to go to sleep? Here I'm referring to the failure of the West to react intelligently and thoughtfully to a new world environment that's obviously been created by the return of Asia. As a friend of the West I feel anguished by this, so my goal to today is to try to help the West. But I have to begin the story first by talking about how the West actually woke up the rest of the world. Look at chart one. From the year one through the year 1820, the two largest economies of the world were always those of China and India. So it's only in the last 200 years that Europe took off, followed by North America. So the past 200 years of world history have therefore been a major historical aberration. All aberrations come to a natural end and this is what we are seeing. And if you look at chart two, you'll see how quickly and how forcefully China and India are coming back. The big question is: Who woke up China and India? The only honest answer to this question is that it was Western civilization that did so. We all know that the West was the first to successfully modernize, transform itself; initially it used its power to colonize and dominate the world. But over time, it shared the gifts of Western wisdom with the rest of the world. Let me add here that I have personally benefited from the sharing of Western wisdom. When I was born in Singapore, which was then a poor British colony, in 1948, I experienced, like three-quarters of humanity then, extreme poverty. Indeed, on the first day when I went to school at the age of six, I was put in a special feeding program because I was technically undernourished. Now as you can see I'm overnourished. (Laughter) But the greatest gift I got was that of Western education. Now since I've personally traveled this journey from third world poverty to a comfortable middle-class existence, I can speak with great conviction about the impact of Western wisdom and the sharing of Western wisdom with the world. And one particular gift that the West shared was the art of reasoning. Now reasoning was not invented by the West. It's inherent in all cultures and civilizations. Amartya Sen has described how deeply embedded it is in Indian civilization. Yet there's also no doubt that it was the West that carried the art of reasoning to a much higher level. And through the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the West really raised it forcefully, and equally importantly used this, applied it to solve many major practical problems. And the West then shared this art of applied reasoning with the rest of the world, and I can tell you that it led to what I call three silent revolutions. And as an Asian, I can describe how these silent revolutions transformed Asia. The first revolution was in economics. The main reason why so many Asian economies, including the communist societies of China and Vietnam, have performed so spectacularly well in economic development, is because they finally understood, absorbed and are implementing free market economics -- a gift from the West. Adam Smith was right. If you let markets decide, productivity goes up. The second gift was psychological. Here too I can speak from personal experience. When I was young, my mother and her generation believed that life was determined by fate. You couldn't do anything about it. My generation and the generation of Asians after me, believe that we can take charge and we can improve our lives. And this may explain, for example, the spike of entrepreneurship you see all throughout Asia today. And if you travel through Asia today, you will also see the results of the third revolution: the revolution of good governance. Now as a result of good governance -- travel in Asia, you see better health care, better education, better infrastructure, better public policies. It's a different world. Now having transformed the world through the sharing of Western wisdom with the rest of the world, the logical and rational response of the West should have been to say, ""Hey, we have to adjust and adapt to this new world."" Instead, the West chose to go to sleep. Why did it happen? I believe it happened because the West became distracted with two major events. The first event was the end of the Cold War. Yes, the end of the Cold War was a great victory. The West defeated the mighty Soviet Union without firing a shot. Amazing. But you know, when you have a great victory like this, it also leads to arrogance and hubris. And this hubris was best captured in a very famous essay by Francis Fukuyama called ""The End of History?"" Now, Fukuyama was putting across a very sophisticated message, but all that the West heard from this essay was that we, the liberal democracies, we have succeeded, we don't have to change, we don't have to adapt, it's only the rest of the world that has to change and adapt. Unfortunately, like a dangerous opiate, this essay did a lot of brain damage to the West because it put them to sleep just at precisely the moment when China and India were waking up and the West didn't adjust and adapt. The second major event was 9/11, which happened in 2001. And as we know, 9/11 caused a lot of shock and grief. I personally experienced the shock and grief because I was in Manhattan when 9/11 happened. 9/11 also generated a lot of anger, and in this anger, the United States decided to invade Afghanistan and later, Iraq. And unfortunately, partly as a result of this anger, the West didn't notice the significance of another event that happened also in 2001. China joined the World Trade Organization. Now, when you suddenly inject 900 million new workers into the global capitalist system, it would naturally lead to what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction. Western workers lost their jobs, they saw their incomes stagnate, clearly people had to think about new competitive policies, workers needed retraining, workers needed new skills. None of this was done. So partly as a result of this, the United States of America became the only major developed society where the average income of the bottom 50 percent -- yes, 50 percent -- average income went down over a 30-year period, from 1980 to 2010. So partly, as a result of this, it led eventually to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, who exploited the anger of the working classes, who are predominantly white. It also contributed to the rise of populism in Europe. And one wonders, could this populism have been avoided if the West had not been distracted by the end of the Cold War and by 9/11? But the big question we face today is this: Is it too late? Has the West lost everything? And my answer is that it's not too late. It is possible for the West to recover and come back in strength. And using the Western art of reasoning, I would recommend that the West adopt a new ""three-m"" strategy: minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian. (Laughter) Why minimalist? Now even though Western domination has ended, the West continues to intervene and interfere in the affairs of many other societies. This is unwise. This is generating anger and resentment, especially in Islamic societies. It's also draining the resources and spirits of Western societies. Now I know that the Islamic world is having difficulties modernizing. It will have to find its way, but it's more likely to do so if it is left alone to do so. Now I can say this with some conviction because I come from a region, Southeast Asia, which has almost as many Muslims as the Arab world. 266 million Muslims. Southeast Asia is also one of the most diverse continents on planet earth, because you also have 146 million Christians, 149 million Buddhists -- Mahayana Buddhists and Hinayana Buddhists -- and you also have millions of Taoists and Confucianists and Hindus and even communists. And once known as ""the Balkans of Asia,"" southeast Asia today should be experiencing a clash of civilizations. Instead, what you see in southeast Asia is one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of planet earth with the second-most successful regional multilateral organization, ASEAN. So clearly, minimalism can work. The West should try it out. (Laughter) (Applause) But I'm also aware that minimalism cannot solve all the problems. There are some hard problems that have to be dealt with: Al-Qaeda, ISIS -- they remain dangerous threats. They must be found, they must be destroyed. The question is, is it wise for the West, which represents 12 percent of the world's population -- yes, 12 percent -- to fight these threats on its own or to fight with the remaining 88 percent of the world's population? And the logical and rational answer is that you should work with the remaining 88 percent. Now where does one go if you want to get the support of humanity? There's only one place: the United Nations. Now I've been ambassador to the UN twice. Maybe that makes me a bit biased, but I can tell you that working with the UN can lead to success. Why is it that the first Iraq war, fought by President George H. W. Bush, succeeded? While the second Iraq war, fought by his son, President George W. Bush, failed? One key reason is that the senior Bush went to the UN to get the support of the global community before fighting the war in Iraq. So multilateralism works. There's another reason why we have to work with the UN. The world is shrinking. We are becoming a small, interdependent, global village. All villages need village councils. And the only global village counsel we have, as the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, is the UN. Now as a geopolitical analyst, I do know that it's often considered naive to work with the UN. So now let me inject my Machiavellian point. Now Machiavelli is a figure who's often derided in the West, but the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin reminded us that the goal of Machiavelli was to promote virtue, not evil. So what is the Machiavellian point? It's this: what is the best way for the West to constrain the new rising powers that are emerging? And the answer is that the best way to constrain them is through multilateral rules and multilateral norms, multilateral institutions and multilateral processes. Now let me conclude with one final, big message. As a longtime friend of the West, I'm acutely aware of how pessimistic Western societies have become. Many in the West don't believe that a great future lies ahead for them, that their children will not have better lives. So please do not fear the future or the rest of the world. Now I can say this with some conviction, because as a Hindu Sindhi, I actually feel a direct cultural connection with society's diverse cultures and societies all the way from Tehran to Tokyo. And more than half of humanity lives in this space, so with this direct cultural connection, I can say with great conviction that if the West chooses to adopt a wiser strategy of being minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian, the rest of the world will be happy to work with the West. So a great future lies ahead for humanity. Let's embrace it together. Thank you. (Applause)"
7:14,Marc Bamuthi Joseph,"""You Have the Rite""",Aug 2019,"Me and the boy wear the same shoe size. He wants a pair of Air Jordan 4s for Christmas. I buy them, and then I steal them from his closet, like a twisted Grinch-themed episode of ""Black-ish."" (Laughter) The kicks are totems to my youth. I wear them like mercury on my Black man feet. I can't get those young freedom days back fast enough. Last time I was really fast I was 16, outrunning a doorman on the Upper East Side. He caught me vandalizing his building, not even on some artsy stuff, just ... stupid. Of all the genders, boys are the stupidest. (Laughter) Sixteen was a series of barely getting away and never telling my parents. I assume that my son is stewarding this tradition well. Sixteen was ""The Low End Theory"" and Marvin Gaye on repeat. Sixteen is younger than Trayvon and older than Emmett Till. At the DMV, my boy's in line to officially enter his prime suspect years: young, brown and behind the wheel, a moving semaphore, signaling the threat of communities from below. On top of the food chain, humans have no natural predator, but America plays out something genetically embedded and instinctual in its appetite for the Black body. America guns down Black bodies and then walks around them, bored, like laconic lions next to half-eaten gazelles, bloody lips ... ""America and the Black Body"" on some Nat Geo shit. Well, he passes his road test at the DMV. He does this strut C-Walk broken ""Fortnite"" thing on the way in to finish his paperwork, true joy and calibrated cool under the eye of my filming iPhone, the victory dance of someone who has just salvaged a draw. He's earned this win, but he's so 16 he can't quite let his body be fully free. When he's three, I'm in handcuffs in downtown Oakland. Five minutes ago, I was illegally parked. Now I'm in the back of a squad car, considering the odds that I'm going to die here, 15 minutes away from my son who expects that in 18 minutes, daddy's gonna pick him up from preschool. There are no pocket-size cameras to capture this moment, so. I learned a lot of big words when I was 16 getting ready for the SAT, but none of them come to me now. In the police car, the only thing that really speaks is my skin. I know this: I was parked on a bus zone on 12th and Broadway, running to the ATM on the corner. I pull the cash out just as a police car pulls up behind me, give him the ""Aw shucks, my bad,"" that earnest Black man face. He waits till I'm back in the car and then hits the siren, takes my license with his hand on the gun, comes back two minutes later, gun drawn, another patrol car now, four cops now, my face on the curb, hands behind my back, shackled. I'm angry and humiliated, only until I'm scared and then sad. I smell like the last gasp before my own death. I think how long the boy will wait before he realizes that daddy is not on his way. I think his last barely formed memory of me will be the story of how I never came for him. I try to telepathically say goodbye. The silence brings me no peace. The quiet makes it hard to rest. In the void there is anger mushrooming in the moss at the base of my thoughts, a fungus growing on the spine of my freedom attempts. I'm free from all except contempt, the spirit of an unarmed civilian in the time of civil unrest, no peace, just Marvin Gaye falsettos arching like a broken-winged sparrow, competing against the empty sirens, singing the police. Apparently some cat from Richmond had a warrant out on him, and when the cop says my name to dispatch, dude doesn't hear ""Marc Joseph,"" he hears ""Mike Johnson."" I count seven cars and 18 cops on the corner now, a pride around a pound of flesh. By the grace of God, I'm not fed to the beast today. Magnanimously, the first cop makes sure to give me a ticket for parking in a bus zone, before he sets me free. The boy is 16. He has a license to drive in the hollow city, enough body to fill my shoes. I have grey in my beard, and it tells the truth. He can navigate traffic in the age of autonomous vehicles. You know, people say ""the talk,"" like the thing happens just once, like my memory's been erased and my internet is broken, like I can't read today's martyred name, like today's the day that I don't love my son enough to tell him, ""Bro, I really don't care about your rights, yo. Your mission is to get home to me. Live to tell me the story, boy. Get home to me."" Today's talk is mostly happening in my head as he pulls onto the freeway and Marvin Gaye comes on the radio. I'm wearing the boy's shoes, and the tune in my head is the goodbye that I almost never said, a goodbye the length of a requiem, a kiss, a whiff of his neck, the length of a revelation and a request flying high in the friendly sky without ever leaving the ground. My pain is a walking bass line, a refrain, placated stress against the fading baseline. Listen, this is not to be romantic, but to assert a plausible scenario for the existential moment. Driving while Black is its own genre of experience. Ask Marvin. It may not be the reason why you sing like an angel, but it surely has something to do with why heaven bends to your voice. The boy driving, the cop in the rearview mirror is a ticket to ride or die. When you give a Black boy ""the talk,"" you pray he is of the faction of the fraction that survives. You pitch him the frequency of your telepathic goodbye, channel the love sustained in Marvin's upper register under his skullcap. Black music at its best is an exploded black hole responding to the call of America at its worst. Strike us down, the music lives, dark, like tar or tobacco or cotton in muddy water. Get home to me, son. Like a love supreme, a god as love, a love overrules, feathers for the angelic lift of the restless dead, like a theme for trouble man, or a 16-year-old boy, free to make mistakes and live through them, grow from them, holy, holy, mercy, mercy me, mercy, mercy. Thank you. (Applause)"
5:51,Ivonne Roman,How policewomen make communities safer,Jul 2019,"I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years. That's crazy, right? And in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief. A few years ago, I noticed something alarming. Starting in 2014, I started monitoring recruits as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey, and I found that women were failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent, due to varying aspects of the physical fitness test. I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout sessions. This had the greatest impact on women. The change meant that recruits had about three weeks out of a five-month-long academy to pass the fitness exam. This just didn't make sense, though. Police agencies and police recruits had made huge investments to get those recruits into the academy. Police recruits had passed lengthy background checks, they had passed medical and psychological exams, they had quit their jobs. And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out within the first three weeks? The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States. I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers. A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years. And they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013, the last time the data was collected. We know that we can improve those rates. Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen. And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021. Other countries are actively working to increase the number of women in policing, because they know of a vast body of research evidence, spanning more than 50 years, detailing the advantages to women in policing. From that research, we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to be accused of excessive force. We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit or a citizen complaint. We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduces the use of force among other officers. And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force as their male counterparts, and sometimes more, and yet they're more successful in defusing violent or aggressive behavior overall. So there are vast advantages to women in policing, and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standards. The problem is, the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies -- 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards. We know that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing that works to decrease the number of women in policing. These types of academies overemphasize physical strength, with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing, problem-solving and interpersonal communication skills. This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing. Physical agility is but a small component of police work. Much of an officer's day is spent mediating interpersonal conflicts. That's the reality of policing. These are my babies. And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. The federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs. And that's based on science. Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects, like the FBI, the US Marshals Service, the DEA and even the US military -- they rigorously test fitness programs to ensure they measure fitness without gender-disparate outcomes. Why is that? Because recruiting is expensive. They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates. You know what else the research finds? Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police. The law-enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis. Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can. We can easily recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training well-qualified candidates to pass validated, work-related, physiologically-based fitness exams, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. We can increase the number of women, we can reduce that gender disparity, by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. We have the tools. We have the research, we have the science, we have the law. This, my friends, should be a very easy fix. Thank you. (Applause)"
15:17,Elizabeth Howell,"How we can improve maternal healthcare — before, during and after pregnancy",Jul 2019,"It was chaos as I got off the elevator. I was coming back on duty as a resident physician to cover the labor and delivery unit. And all I could see was a swarm of doctors and nurses hovering over a patient in the labor room. They were all desperately trying to save a woman's life. The patient was in shock. She had delivered a healthy baby boy a few hours before I arrived. Suddenly, she collapsed, became unresponsive, and had profuse uterine bleeding. By the time I got to the room, there were multiple doctors and nurses, and the patient was lifeless. The resuscitation team tried to bring her back to life, but despite everyone's best efforts, she died. What I remember most about that day was the father's piercing cry. It went through my heart and the heart of everyone on that floor. This was supposed to be the happiest day of his life, but instead it turned out to be the worst day. I wish I could say this tragedy was an isolated incident, but sadly, that's not the case. Every year in the United States, somewhere between 700 and 900 women die from a pregnancy-related cause. The shocking part of this story is that our maternal mortality rate is actually higher than all other high-income countries, and our rates are far worse for women of color. Our rate of maternal mortality actually increased over the last decade, while other countries reduced their rates. And the biggest paradox of all? We spend more on health care than any other country in the world. Well, around the same time in residency that this new mother lost her life, I became a mother myself. And even with all of my background and training in the field, I was taken aback by how little attention was paid to delivering high-quality maternal health care. And I thought about what that meant, not just for myself but for so many other women. Maybe it's because my dad was a civil rights attorney and my parents were socially conscious and demanded that we stand up for what we believe in. Or the fact that my parents were born in Jamaica, came to the United States and were able to realize the American Dream. Or maybe it was my residency training, where I saw firsthand how poorly so many low-income women of color were treated by our healthcare system. For whatever the reason, I felt a responsibility to stand up, not just for myself, but for all women, and especially those marginalized by our healthcare system. And I decided to focus my career on improving maternal health care. So what's killing mothers? Cardiovascular disease, hemorrhage, high blood pressure causing seizures and strokes, blood clots and infection are some of the major causes of maternal mortality in this country. But a maternal death is only the tip of the iceberg. For every death, over a hundred women suffer a severe complication related to pregnancy and childbirth, resulting in over 60,000 women every year having one of these events. These complications, called severe maternal morbidity, are on the rise in the United States, and they're life-altering. It's estimated that somewhere between 1.5 and two percent of the four million deliveries that occur every year in this country are associated with one of these events. That is five or six women every hour having a blood clot, a seizure, a stroke, receiving a blood transfusion, having end-organ damage such as kidney failure, or some other tragic event. Now, the part of this story that's frankly unforgivable is the fact that 60 percent of these deaths and severe complications are thought to be preventable. When I say 60 percent are preventable, I mean there are concrete steps and standard procedures that we could implement that could prevent these bad outcomes from occurring and save women's lives. And it doesn't require fancy new technology. We just have to apply what we know and ensure equal standards between hospitals. For example, if a pregnant woman in labor has really high blood pressure and we treat her with the right antihypertensive medication in a timely fashion, we can prevent stroke. If we accurately track blood loss during delivery, we can detect a hemorrhage sooner and save a woman's life. We could actually lower the rates of these catastrophic events tomorrow, but it requires that we value the quality of care we deliver to pregnant women before, during and after pregnancy. If we raise quality of care universally to what is supposed to be the standard, we could bring the rates of these deaths and severe complications way down. Well, there is some good news. There are some success stories. There are some places that have actually adopted these standards, and it's really making a difference. A few years ago, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists joined forces with other healthcare organizations, researchers like myself and community organizations. They wanted to implement standard care practices in hospitals and health systems throughout the country. And the vehicle they're using is a program called the Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health, the AIM program. Their goal is to lower maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates through quality and safety initiatives across the country. The group has developed a number of safety bundles that target some of the most preventable causes of a maternal death. The AIM program currently has the potential to reach over 50 percent of US births. So what's in a safety bundle? Evidence-based practices, protocols, procedures, medications, equipment and other items targeting these conditions. Let's take the example of a hemorrhage bundle. For a hemorrhage, you need a cart that has everything a doctor or nurse might need in an emergency: an IV line, an oxygen mask, medications, checklists, other equipment. Then you need something to measure blood loss: sponges and pads. And instead of just eyeballing it, the doctors and nurses collect these sponges and pads and either weigh them or use newer technology to accurately assess how much blood has been lost. The hemorrhage bundle also includes crises protocols for massive transfusions and regular trainings and drills. Now, California has been a leader in the use of these types of bundles, and that's why California saw a 21 percent reduction in near death from hemorrhage among hospitals that implemented this bundle in the first year. Yet the use of these bundles across the country is spotty or missing. Just like the fact that the use of evidence-based practices and the emphasis on safety differs from one hospital to the next, quality of care differs. And quality of care differs greatly for women of color in the United States. Black women who deliver in this country are three to four times more likely to suffer a pregnancy-related death than are white women. This statistic is true for all black women who deliver in this country, whether they were born in the United States or born in another country. Many want to think that income differences drive these disparities, but it goes beyond class. A black woman with a college education is nearly twice as likely to die as compared to a white woman with less than a high school education. And she is two to three times more likely to suffer a severe pregnancy complication with her delivery. Now, I was always taught to think that education was our salvation, but in this case, it's simply not true. This black-white disparity is the largest disparity among all population perinatal health measures, according to the CDC. And these disparities are even more pronounced in some of our cities. For example, in New York City, a black woman is eight to 12 times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than is a white woman. Now, I think many of you are probably familiar with the heart-wrenching story of Dr. Shalon Irving, a CDC epidemiologist who died following childbirth. Her story was reported in ProPublica and NPR a little less than a year ago. Recently, I was at a conference and I had the privilege of hearing her mother speak. She brought the entire audience to tears. Shalon was a brilliant epidemiologist, committed to studying racial and ethnic disparities in health. She was 36 years old, this was her first baby, and she was African-American. Now, Shalon did have a complicated pregnancy, but she delivered a healthy baby girl and was discharged from the hospital. Three weeks later, she died from complications of high blood pressure. Shalon was seen four or five times by healthcare professionals in those three weeks. She was not listened to, and the severity of her condition was not recognized. Now, Shalon's story is just one of many stories about racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care in the United States, and there's a growing recognition that the social determinants of health, such as racism, poverty, education, segregated housing, contribute to these disparities. But Shalon's story highlights an additional underlying cause: quality of care. Lack of standards in postpartum care. Shalon was seen multiple times by clinicians in those three weeks, and she still died. Quality of care in the setting of childbirth is an underlying cause of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the United States, and it's something we can address now. Research by our team and others has documented that, for a variety of reasons, black women tend to deliver in a specific set of hospitals, and those hospitals often have worse outcomes for both black and white women, regardless of patient risk factors. This is true overall in the United States, where about three quarters of all black women deliver in a specific set of hospitals, while less than one-fifth of white women deliver in those same hospitals. In New York City, a woman's risk of having a life-threatening complication during delivery can be six times higher in one hospital than another. Not surprisingly, black women are more likely to deliver in hospitals with worse outcomes. In fact, differences in delivery hospital explain nearly one-half of the black-white disparity. While we must address social determinants of health if we're ever going to truly have equitable health care in this country, many of these are deep-seated and they will take some time to resolve. In the meantime, we can tackle quality of care. Providing high-quality care across the care continuum means providing access to safe and reliable contraception throughout women's reproductive lives. Before pregnancy, it means providing preconception care, so we can manage chronic illness and optimize health. During pregnancy, it includes high-quality prenatal and delivery care so we can produce healthy moms and babies. And finally, after pregnancy, it includes postpartum and inter-pregnancy care so we can set moms up to have a healthy next baby and a healthy life. And it can literally spell the difference between life and death, as it did in the case of Maria, who checked into the hospital after having an elevated blood pressure during a prenatal visit. Maria was 40, and this was her second pregnancy. During Maria's first pregnancy that had happened two years earlier, she also didn't feel so well in the last few weeks of her pregnancy, and she had a few elevated blood pressures, but nobody seemed to pay attention. They just said, ""Maria, don't worry, you'll be fine. This is your first pregnancy. You're a little nervous."" But it did not end well for Maria last time. She seized during labor. Well, this time her team really listened. They asked smart and probing questions. Her doctor counseled her about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and explained that if she was not feeling well, she needed to come in and be seen. And this time Maria came in, and her doctor immediately sent her to the hospital. At the hospital, her doctor ordered urgent lab tests. They hooked her up to multiple different monitors and paid special attention to her blood pressure, the fetal heart rate tracing and gave her IV medication to prevent a seizure. And when Maria's blood pressure got so high it put her at risk for a stroke, her doctors and nurses jumped into action. They repeated her blood pressure in 15 minutes and declared a hypertensive emergency. They gave her the right IV medication according to the latest correct protocol. They worked smoothly together as a coordinated team and successfully lowered her blood pressure. As a result, what could have been a tragedy became a success story. Maria's dangerous symptoms were controlled, and she delivered a healthy baby girl. And before Maria was discharged from the hospital, her doctor counseled her again about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, the importance of having her blood pressure checked, especially in this first week postpartum and gave her education about postpartum health and what to expect. And in the weeks and months that followed, naturally, Maria had follow-up visits with her pediatrician to check in on her baby's health. But just as important, she had follow-up visits with her ob-gyn to check in on her health, her blood pressure, and her cares and concerns as a new mother. This is what high-quality care across the care continuum looks like, and this is how it can look. If every pregnant woman in every community received this kind of high-quality care and delivered at facilities that utilized standard care practices, our maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates would plummet. Our international ranking would no longer be an embarrassment. But the truth is, we've had decades of unacceptably high rates of maternal death and life-threatening complications during delivery and decades of devastating consequences for moms, babies and families, and we have not been moved to action. The recent media attention on our poor performance on maternal mortality has helped the public to understand: high-quality maternal health care is within reach. The question is: Are we as a society ready to value pregnant women from every community? For my part, I'm doing everything I can to ensure that when we do, we have the tools and evidence base ready to move forward. Thank you. (Applause)"
12:42,Harrison Scott Key,The funny thing about the American Dream,Jun 2019,
17:25,Michael Tubbs,The political power of being a good neighbor,Jun 2019,"So I know for sure there's at least one thing I have in common with dentists. I absolutely hate the holiday of Halloween. Now, this hatred stems not from a dislike of cavities, nor was it a lifetime in the making. Rather, this hatred stems from a particular incident that happened nine years ago. Nine years ago, I was even younger, I was 20 years old, and I was an intern in the White House. The other White House. And my job was to work with mayors and councilors nationwide. November 1, 2010 began just like any other day. I turned on the computer, went on Google and prepared to write my news clips. I was met with a call from my mother, which isn't that out the norm, my mom likes to text, call, email, Facebook, Instagram, all that. So I answered the phone expecting to hear maybe some church gossip, or maybe something from WorldStarHipHop she had discovered. But when I answered the phone, I was met with a tone that was unlike anything I had ever heard from my mother. My mother's loud. But she spoke in a hush, still, muffled tone that conveyed a sense of sadness. And as she whispered, she said, ""Michael, your cousin Donnell was murdered last night, on Halloween, at a house party in Stockton."" And like far too many people in this country, particularly from communities like mine, particularly that look like me, I spent the better part of the year dealing with anger, rage, nihilism, and I had a choice to make. The choice was one between action and apathy. The choice was what could I do to put purpose to this pain. I spent a year dealing with feelings of survivor's guilt. What was the point of me being at Stanford, what was the point of me being at the White House if I was powerless to help my own family? And my own family was dying, quite literally. I then began to feel a little selfish and say, what's the point of even trying to make the world a better place? Maybe that's just the way it is. Maybe I would be smart to take advantage of all the opportunities given to me and make as much money as possible, so I'm comfortable, and my immediate family is comfortable. But finally, towards the end of that year, I realized I wanted to do something. So I made the crazy decision, as a senior in college, to run for city council. That decision was unlikely for a couple of reasons, and not just my age. You see, my family is far from a political dynasty. More men in my family have been incarcerated than in college. In fact, as I speak today, my father is still incarcerated. My mother, she had me as a teenager, and government wasn't something we had warm feelings from. You see, it was the government that red-lined the neighborhoods I grew up in. Full of liquor stores and no grocery stores, there was a lack of opportunity and concentrated poverty. It was the government and the politicians that made choices, like the war on drugs and three strikes, that have incarcerated far too many people in our country. It was the government and political actors that made the decisions that created the school funding formulas, that made it so the school I went to receive less per pupil spending than schools in more affluent areas. So there was nothing about that background that made it likely for me to choose to be involved in being a government actor. And at the same time, Stockton was a very unlikely place. Stockton is my home town, a city of 320,000 people. But historically, it's been a place people run from, rather than come back to. It's a city that's incredibly diverse. Thirty-five percent Latino, 35 percent white, 20 percent Asian, 10 percent African American, the oldest Sikh temple in North America. But at the time I ran for office, we were also the largest city in the country at that time to declare bankruptcy. At the time I decided to run for office, we also had more murders per capita than Chicago. At the time I decided to run for office, we had a 23 percent poverty rate, a 17 percent college attainment rate and a host of challenges and issues beyond the scope of any 21-year-old. So after I won my election, I did what I usually do when I feel overwhelmed, I realized the problems of Stockton were far bigger than me and that I might need a little divine intervention. So as I prepared for my first council meeting, I went back to some wisdom my grandmother taught me. A parable I think we all know, that really constitutes the governing frame we're using to reinvent Stockton today. I remember in Sunday school, my grandmother told me that at one time, a guy asked Jesus, ""Who was my neighbor? Who was my fellow citizen? Who am I responsible for?"" And instead of a short answer, Jesus replied with a parable. He said there was a man on a journey, walking down Jericho Road. As he was walking down the road, he was beat up, left on the side of the road, stripped of all his clothes, had everything stolen from and left to die. And then a priest came by, saw the man on the side of the road, maybe said a silent prayer, hopes and prayers, prayers that he gets better. Maybe saw the man on the side of the road and surmised that it was ordained by God for this particular man, this particular group to be on the side of the road, there's nothing I can do to change it. After the priest walked by, maybe a politician walked by. A 28-year-old politician, for example. Saw the man on the side of the road and saw how beat up the man was, saw that the man was a victim of violence, or fleeing violence. And the politician decided, ""You know what? Instead of welcoming this man in, let's build a wall. Maybe the politician said, ""Maybe this man chose to be on the side of the road."" That if he just pulled himself up by his bootstraps, despite his boots being stolen, and got himself back on the horse, he could be successful, and there's nothing I could do."" And then finally, my grandmother said, a good Samaritan came by, saw the man on the side of the road and looked and saw not centuries of hatred between Jews and Samaritans, looked and saw not his fears reflected, not economic anxiety, not ""what's going to happen to me because things are changing."" But looked and saw a reflection of himself. He saw his neighbor, he saw his common humanity. He didn't just see it, he did something about it, my grandmother said. He got down on one knee, he made sure the man was OK, and I heard, even gave him a room at that nice Fairmont, the Pan Pacific one. (Laughter) And as I prepared to govern, I realized that given the diversity of Stockton, the first step to making change will be to again answer the same question: Who is our neighbor? And realizing that our destiny as a city was tied up in everyone. Particularly those who are left on the side of the road. But then I realized that charity isn't justice, that acts of empathy isn't justice, that being a good neighbor is necessary but not sufficient, and there was more that had to be done. So looking at the story, I realized that the road, Jericho Road, has a nickname. It's known as the Bloody Pass, the Ascent of Red, because the road is structured for violence. This Jericho Road is narrow, it's conducive for ambushing. Meaning, a man on the side of the road wasn't abnormal. Wasn't strange. And in fact, it was something that was structured to happen, it was supposed to happen. And Johan Galtung, a peace theorist, talks about structural violence in our society. He says, ""Structural violence is the avoidable impairment of basic human needs."" Dr. Paul Farmer talks about structural violence and talks about how it's the way our institutions, our policies, our culture creates outcomes that advantage some people and disadvantage others. And then I realized, much like the road in Jericho, in many ways, Stockton, our society, has been structured for the outcomes we complain about. That we should not be surprised when we see that kids in poverty don't do well in school, that we should not be surprised to see wealth gaps by race and ethnicity. We should not be surprised to see income pay disparities between genders, because that's what our society, historically, has been structured to do, and it's working accordingly. (Applause) So taking this wisdom, I rolled up my sleeves and began to work. And there's three quick stories I want to share, that point to not that we figured everything out, not that we have arrived, but we're trending in the right direction. The first story, about the neighbor. When I was a city council member, I was working with one of the most conservative members in our community on opening a health clinic for undocumented people in the south part of the city, and I loved it. And as we opened the clinic, we had a resolution to sign, he presented me a gift. It was an O'Reilly Factor lifetime membership pin. (Laughter) Mind you, I didn't ask what he did to get such a gift. What blood oath --  I had no idea how he got it. But I looked at him and I said, ""Well, how are we working together to open a health clinic, to provide free health care for undocumented people, and you're an O'Reilly Factor member?"" He looked at me and said, ""Councilman Tubbs, this is for my neighbors."" And he's a great example of what it means to be a good neighbor, at least in that instance. The robbers. So after four years on city council, I decided to run for mayor, realizing that being a part-time councilman wasn't enough to enact the structural changes we need to see in Stockton, and I came to that conclusion by looking at the data. So my old council district, where I grew up, is 10 minutes away from a more affluent district. And 10 minutes away in the same city, the difference between zip code 95205 and 95219 in life expectancy is 10 years. Ten minutes away, 4.5 miles, 10 years life expectancy difference, and not because of the choices people are making. Because no one chose to live in an unsafe community where they can't exercise. No one chose to put more liquor stores than grocery stores in the community. No one chose these things, but that's the reality. I realized, as a councilman, to enact a structural change I wanted to see, where between the same zip codes there's a 30 percent difference in the rate of unemployment, there's a 75,000 dollars a year difference in income, that being a councilman was not going to cut it. So that's when I decided to run for mayor. And as mayor, we've been focused on the robbers and the road. So in Stockton, as I mentioned, we have historically had problems with violent crime. In fact, that's why I decided to run for office in the first place. And my first job as mayor was helping our community to see ourselves, our neighbors, not just in the people victimized by violence but also in the perpetrators. We realized that those who enact pain in our society, those who are committing homicides and contributing to gun violence, are oftentimes victims themselves. They have high rates of trauma, they have been shot at, they've known people who have been shot. That doesn't excuse their behavior, but it helps explain it, and as a community, we have to see these folks as us, too. That they too are our neighbors. So for the past three years -- (Applause) So for the past three years, we've been working on two strategies: Ceasefire and Advance Peace, where we give these guys as much attention, as much love from social services, from opportunities, from tattoo removals, in some cases even cash, as a gift from law enforcement. And last year, we saw a 40 percent reduction in homicides and a 30 percent reduction in violent crime. (Applause) And now, the road. I mentioned that my community has a 23 percent poverty rate. As someone who comes from poverty, it's a personal issue for me. So I decided that we wouldn't just do a program, or we wouldn't just do something to go around the edges, but we would call into question the very structure that produces poverty in the first place. So starting in February, we launched a basic income demonstration, where for the next 18 months, as a pilot, 130 families, randomly selected, who live in zip codes at or below the median income of the city, are given 500 dollars a month. And we're doing this for a couple of reasons. We're doing it because we realize that something is structurally wrong in America, when one in two Americans can't afford one 400-dollar emergency. We're doing it because we realize that something is structurally wrong when wages have only increased six percent between 1979 and 2013. We're doing it because we realize something is structurally wrong when people working two and three jobs, doing all the jobs no one in here wants to do, can't pay for necessities, like rent, like lights, like health care, like childcare. (Applause) So I would say, Stockton again, we have real issues. I have constituent emails in my phone now, about the homelessness issue, about some of the violent crime we're still experiencing. But I would say, I think as a society, we would be wise to go back to those old Bible stories we were taught growing up, and understand that number one, we have to begin to see each other as neighbors, that when we see someone different from us, they should not reflect our fears, our anxieties, our insecurities, the prejudices we've been taught, our biases -- but we should see ourselves. We should see our common humanity. Because I think once we do that, we can do the more important work of restructuring the road. Because again, I understand some listening are saying, ""Well, Mayor Tubbs, you're talking about structural violence and structural this, but you're on the stage. That the structures can't be too bad if you could come up from poverty, have a father in jail, go to Stanford, work in the White House and become mayor."" And I would respond by saying the term for that is exceptionalism. Meaning that we recognize it's exceptional for people to escape the structures. Meaning by our very language, we understand that the things we're seeing in our world are by design. And I think that task for us, as TEDsters, and as good people, just people, moral people, is really do the hard work necessary of not just joining hands as neighbors, but using our hands to restructure our road, a road that in this country has been rooted in things like white supremacy. A road like in this country has been rooted in things like misogyny. A road that's not working for far too many people. And I think today, tomorrow and 2020 we have a chance to change that. So as I prepare to close, I started with a story from nine years ago and I'll end with one. So after my cousin was murdered, I was lucky enough to go on the Freedom Rides with some of the original freedom riders. And they taught me a lot about restructuring the road. And one guy in particular, Bob Singleton, asked me a question I'm going to leave with us today. We were going to Anniston, Alabama, and he said, ""Michael,"" and I said, ""Yes, sir."" He said, ""I was arrested on August 4, 1961. Now why is that day important?"" And I said, ""Well, you were arrested, if you weren't arrested, we wouldn't be on this bus. if we weren't on this bus, we wouldn't have the rights we enjoy."" He rolled his eyes and said, ""No, son."" He said, ""On that day, Barack Obama was born."" And then he said he had no idea that the choice he made to restructure the road would pave the way, so a child born as a second class citizen, who wouldn't be able to even get a cup of water at a counter, would have the chance, 50 years later, to be president. Then he looked at me and he said, ""What are you prepared to do today so that 50 years from now a child born has a chance to be president?"" And I think, TED, that's the question before us today. We know things are jacked up. I think what we've seen recently isn't abnormal but a reflection of a system that's been structured to produce such crazy outcomes. But I think it's also an opportunity. Because these structures we inherit aren't acts of God but acts of men and women, they're policy choices, they're by politicians like me, approved by voters like you. And we have the chance and the awesome opportunity to do something about it. So my question is: What are we prepared to do today, so that a child born today, 50 years from now isn't born in a society rooted in white supremacy; isn't born into a society riddled with misogyny; isn't born into a society riddled with homophobia and transphobia and anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and ableism, and all the phobias and -isms? What are we prepared to do today, so that 50 years from now we have a road in our society that's structured to reflect what we hold to be self-evident? That all men, that all women, that even all trans people are created equal and are endowed by your Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Thank you. (Applause)"
5:05,Brian A. Pavlac,Ugly History: Witch Hunts,Jun 2019,"In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found  herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning,  and denied the charges. She continued to insist she wasn’t a witch through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier in the same town, faced a worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would  confess under torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at the stake  in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the  witch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American  colonies from the late 15th century  until the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified  initiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred  sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken  on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone  who allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread  through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope  gave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in  search of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local authorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning of respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the  ""Malleus Maleficarum,"" or ""Hammer of Witches."" The text argued for the existence of  witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting and prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for the devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write  their own books and give sermons on the  dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including  kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the  devil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support any of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began  with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow,  or a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft,  and accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on  the fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community could be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged  witch hunts, local secular governments usually carried  out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were  questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent  people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred  sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged  from small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were  accused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a  few hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters  probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t  consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed  in witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by  rooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians  countered books like Kraemer’s ""Hammer of Witches"" with texts objecting to the  cruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions,  and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th  century, their arguments gained force with the rise of stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it  disappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these  atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned  dissent to combat those false beliefs."
14:54,David Brooks,The lies our culture tells us about what matters — and a better way to live,Jun 2019,"So, we all have bad seasons in life. And I had one in 2013. My marriage had just ended, and I was humiliated by that failed commitment. My kids had left home for college or were leaving. I grew up mostly in the conservative movement, but conservatism had changed, so I lost a lot of those friends, too. And so what I did is, I lived alone in an apartment, and I just worked. If you opened the kitchen drawers where there should have been utensils, there were Post-it notes. If you opened the other drawers where there should have been plates, I had envelopes. I had work friends, weekday friends, but I didn't have weekend friends. And so my weekends were these long, howling silences. And I was lonely. And loneliness, unexpectedly, came to me in the form of -- it felt like fear, a burning in my stomach. And it felt a little like drunkenness, just making bad decisions, just fluidity, lack of solidity. And the painful part of that moment was the awareness that the emptiness in my apartment was just reflective of the emptiness in myself, and that I had fallen for some of the lies that our culture tells us. The first lie is that career success is fulfilling. I've had a fair bit of career success, and I've found that it helps me avoid the shame I would feel if I felt myself a failure, but it hasn't given me any positive good. The second lie is I can make myself happy, that if I just win one more victory, lose 15 pounds, do a little more yoga, I'll get happy. And that's the lie of self-sufficiency. But as anybody on their deathbed will tell you, the things that make people happy is the deep relationships of life, the losing of self-sufficiency. The third lie is the lie of the meritocracy. The message of the meritocracy is you are what you accomplish. The myth of the meritocracy is you can earn dignity by attaching yourself to prestigious brands. The emotion of the meritocracy is conditional love, you can ""earn"" your way to love. The anthropology of the meritocracy is you're not a soul to be purified, you're a set of skills to be maximized. And the evil of the meritocracy is that people who've achieved a little more than others are actually worth a little more than others. And so the wages of sin are sin. And my sins were the sins of omission-- not reaching out, failing to show up for my friends, evasion, avoiding conflict. And the weird thing was that as I was falling into the valley -- it was a valley of disconnection -- a lot of other people were doing that, too. And that's sort of the secret to my career; a lot of the things that happen to me are always happening to a lot of other people. I'm a very average person with above average communication skills. (Laughter) And so I was detached. And at the same time, a lot of other people were detached and isolated and fragmented from each other. Thirty-five percent of Americans over 45 are chronically lonely. Only eight percent of Americans report having meaningful conversation with their neighbors. Only 32 percent of Americans say they trust their neighbors, and only 18 percent of millennials. The fastest-growing political party is unaffiliated. The fastest-growing religious movement is unaffiliated. Depression rates are rising, mental health problems are rising. The suicide rate has risen 30 percent since 1999. For teen suicides over the last several years, the suicide rate has risen by 70 percent. Forty-five thousand Americans kill themselves every year; 72,000 die from opioid addictions; life expectancy is falling, not rising. So what I mean to tell you, I flew out here to say that we have an economic crisis, we have environmental crisis, we have a political crisis. We also have a social and relational crisis; we're in the valley. We're fragmented from each other, we've got cascades of lies coming out of Washington ... We're in the valley. And so I've spent the last five years -- how do you get out of a valley? The Greeks used to say, ""You suffer your way to wisdom."" And from that dark period where I started, I've had a few realizations. The first is, freedom sucks. Economic freedom is OK, political freedom is great, social freedom sucks. The unrooted man is the adrift man. The unrooted man is the unremembered man, because he's uncommitted to things. Freedom is not an ocean you want to swim in, it's a river you want to get across, so you can commit and plant yourself on the other side. The second thing I learned is that when you have one of those bad moments in life, you can either be broken, or you can be broken open. And we all know people who are broken. They've endured some pain or grief, they get smaller, they get angrier, resentful, they lash out. As the saying is, ""Pain that is not transformed gets transmitted."" But other people are broken open. Suffering's great power is that it's an interruption of life. It reminds you you're not the person you thought you were. The theologian Paul Tillich said what suffering does is it carves through what you thought was the floor of the basement of your soul, and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below, and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below. You realize there are depths of yourself you never anticipated, and only spiritual and relational food will fill those depths. And when you get down there, you get out of the head of the ego and you get into the heart, the desiring heart. The idea that what we really yearn for is longing and love for another, the kind of thing that Louis de Bernières described in his book, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" He had an old guy talking to his daughter about his relationship with his late wife, and the old guy says, ""Love itself is whatever is leftover when being in love is burned away. And this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it. We had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches, we discovered that we are one tree and not two."" That's what the heart yearns for. The second thing you discover is your soul. Now, I don't ask you to believe in God or not believe in God, but I do ask you to believe that there's a piece of you that has no shape, size, color or weight, but that gives you infinite dignity and value. Rich and successful people don't have more of this than less successful people. Slavery is wrong because it's an obliteration of another soul. Rape is not just an attack on a bunch of physical molecules, it's an attempt to insult another person's soul. And what the soul does is it yearns for righteousness. The heart yearns for fusion with another, the soul yearns for righteousness. And that led to my third realization, which I borrowed from Einstein: ""The problem you have is not going to be solved at the level of consciousness on which you created it. You have to expand to a different level of consciousness."" So what do you do? Well, the first thing you do is you throw yourself on your friends and you have deeper conversations that you ever had before. But the second thing you do, you have to go out alone into the wilderness. You go out into that place where there's nobody there to perform, and the ego has nothing to do, and it crumbles, and only then are you capable of being loved. I have a friend who said that when her daughter was born, she realized that she loved her more than evolution required. (Laughter) And I've always loved that. (Applause) Because it talks about the peace that's at the deep of ourself, our inexplicable care for one another. And when you touch that spot, you're ready to be rescued. The hard thing about when you're in the valley is that you can't climb out; somebody has to reach in and pull you out. It happened to me. I got, luckily, invited over to a house by a couple named Kathy and David, and they were -- They had a kid in the DC public school, his name's Santi. Santi had a friend who needed a place to stay because his mom had some health issues. And then that kid had a friend and that kid had a friend. When I went to their house six years ago, I walk in the door, there's like 25 around the kitchen table, a whole bunch sleeping downstairs in the basement. I reach out to introduce myself to a kid, and he says, ""We don't really shake hands here. We just hug here."" And I'm not the huggiest guy on the face of the earth, but I've been going back to that home every Thursday night when I'm in town, and just hugging all those kids. They demand intimacy. They demand that you behave in a way where you're showing all the way up. And they teach you a new way to live, which is the cure for all the ills of our culture which is a way of direct -- really putting relationship first, not just as a word, but as a reality. And the beautiful thing is, these communities are everywhere. I started something at the Aspen Institute called ""Weave: The Social Fabric."" This is our logo here. And we plop into a place and we find weavers anywhere, everywhere. We find people like Asiaha Butler, who grew up in -- who lived in Chicago, in Englewood, in a tough neighborhood. And she was about to move because it was so dangerous, and she looked across the street and she saw two little girls playing in an empty lot with broken bottles, and she turned to her husband and she said, ""We're not leaving. We're not going to be just another family that abandon that."" And she Googled ""volunteer in Englewood,"" and now she runs R.A.G.E., the big community organization there. Some of these people have had tough valleys. I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio who came home from an antiquing trip and found that her husband had killed himself and their two kids. She now runs a free pharmacy, she volunteers in the community, she helps women cope with violence, she teaches. She told me, ""I grew from this experience because I was angry. I was going to fight back against what he tried to do to me by making a difference in the world. See, he didn't kill me. My response to him is, 'Whatever you meant to do to me, screw you, you're not going to do it.'"" These weavers are not living an individualistic life, they're living a relationist life, they have a different set of values. They have moral motivations. They have vocational certitude, they have planted themselves down. I met a guy in Youngstown, Ohio, who just held up a sign in the town square, ""Defend Youngstown."" They have radical mutuality, and they are geniuses at relationship. There's a woman named Mary Gordon who runs something called Roots of Empathy. And what they do is they take a bunch of kids, an eighth grade class, they put a mom and an infant, and then the students have to guess what the infant is thinking, to teach empathy. There was one kid in a class who was bigger than the rest because he'd been held back, been through the foster care system, seen his mom get killed. And he wanted to hold the baby. And the mom was nervous because he looked big and scary. But she let this kid, Darren, hold the baby. He held it, and he was great with it. He gave the baby back and started asking questions about parenthood. And his final question was, ""If nobody has ever loved you, do you think you can be a good father?"" And so what Roots of Empathy does is they reach down and they grab people out of the valley. And that's what weavers are doing. Some of them switch jobs. Some of them stay in their same jobs. But one thing is, they have an intensity to them. I read this -- E.O. Wilson wrote a great book called ""Naturalist,"" about his childhood. When he was seven, his parents were divorcing. And they sent him to Paradise Beach in North Florida. And he'd never seen the ocean before. And he'd never seen a jellyfish before. He wrote, ""The creature was astonishing. It existed beyond my imagination."" He was sitting on the dock one day and he saw a stingray float beneath his feet. And at that moment, a naturalist was born in the awe and wonder. And he makes this observation: that when you're a child, you see animals at twice the size as you do as an adult. And that has always impressed me, because what we want as kids is that moral intensity, to be totally given ourselves over to something and to find that level of vocation. And when you are around these weavers, they see other people at twice the size as normal people. They see deeper into them. And what they see is joy. On the first mountain of our life, when we're shooting for our career, we shoot for happiness. And happiness is good, it's the expansion of self. You win a victory, you get a promotion, your team wins the Super Bowl, you're happy. Joy is not the expansion of self, it's the dissolving of self. It's the moment when the skin barrier disappears between a mother and her child, it's the moment when a naturalist feels just free in nature. It's the moment where you're so lost in your work or a cause, you have totally self-forgotten. And joy is a better thing to aim for than happiness. I collect passages of joy, of people when they lose it. One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith. In 1999, she was in a London nightclub, looking for her friends, wondering where her handbag was. And suddenly, as she writes, ""... a rail-thin man with enormous eyes reached across a sea of bodies for my hand. He kept asking me the same thing over and over, 'Are you feeling it?' My ridiculous heels were killing me, I was terrified that I might die, yet I felt simultaneously overwhelmed with delight that 'Can I Kick It?' should happen to be playing on this precise moment in the history of the world on the sound system, and it was now morphing into 'Teen Spirit.' I took the man's hand, the top of my head blew away, we danced, we danced, we gave ourselves up to joy."" And so what I'm trying to describe is two different life mindsets. The first mountain mindset, which is about individual happiness and career success. And it's a good mindset, I have nothing against it. But we're in a national valley, because we don't have the other mindset to balance it. We no longer feel good about ourselves as a people, we've lost our defining faith in our future, we don't see each other deeply, we don't treat each other as well. And we need a lot of changes. We need an economic change and environmental change. But we also need a cultural and relational revolution. We need to name the language of a recovered society. And to me, the weavers have found that language. My theory of social change is that society changes when a small group of people find a better way to live, and the rest of us copy them. And these weavers have found a better way to live. And you don't have to theorize about it. They are out there as community builders all around the country. We just have to shift our lives a little, so we can say, ""I'm a weaver, we're a weaver."" And if we do that, the hole inside ourselves gets filled, but more important, the social unity gets repaired. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
16:50,Baratunde Thurston,"How to deconstruct racism, one headline at a time",May 2019,"My parents gave me an extraordinary name: Baratunde Rafiq Thurston. Now, Baratunde is based on a Yoruba name from Nigeria, but we're not Nigerian. (Laughter) That's just how black my mama was. (Laughter) ""Get this boy the blackest name possible. What does the book say?"" (Laughter) Rafiq is an Arabic name, but we are not Arabs. My mom just wanted me to have difficulty boarding planes in the 21st century. (Laughter) She foresaw America's turn toward nativism. She was a black futurist. (Laughter) Thurston is a British name, but we are not British. Shoutout to the multigenerational, dehumanizing economic institution of American chattel slavery, though. Also, Thurston makes for a great Starbucks name. Really expedites the process. (Laughter) My mother was a renaissance woman. Arnita Lorraine Thurston was a computer programmer, former domestic worker, survivor of sexual assault, an artist and an activist. She prepared me for this world with lessons in black history, in martial arts, in urban farming, and then she sent me in the seventh grade to the private Sidwell Friends School, where US presidents send their daughters, and where she sent me looking like this. (Laughter) I had two key tasks going to that school: don't lose your blackness and don't lose your glasses. This accomplished both. (Laughter) Sidwell was a great place to learn the arts and the sciences, but also the art of living amongst whiteness. That would prepare me for life later at Harvard, or doing corporate consulting, or for my jobs at ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Onion."" I would write down many of these lessons in my memoir, ""How to Be Black,"" which if you haven't read yet, makes you a racist, because -- (Laughter) you've had plenty of time to read the book. But America insists on reminding me and teaching me what it means to be black in America. It's December 2018, I'm with my fiancé in the suburbs of Wisconsin. We are visiting her parents, both of whom are white, which makes her white. That's how it works. I don't make the rules. (Laughter) She's had some drinks, so I drive us in her parents' car, and we get pulled over by the police. I'm scared. I turn on the flashing lights to indicate compliance. I pull over slowly under the brightest streetlight I can find in case I need witnesses or dashcam footage. We get out my identification, the car registration, lay it out in the open, roll down the windows, my hands are placed on the steering wheel, all before the officer exits the vehicle. This is how to stay alive. As we wait, I think about these headlines -- ""Police shoot another unarmed black person"" -- and I don't want to join them. The good news is, our officer was friendly. She told us our tags were expired. So to all the white parents out there, if your child is involved with a person whose skin tone is rated Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson or darker -- (Laughter) you need to get that car inspected, update the paperwork every time we visit. That's just common courtesy. (Laughter) (Applause) I got lucky. I got a law enforcement professional. I survived something that should not require survival. And I think about this series of stories -- ""Police shoot another unarmed black person"" -- and that season when those stories popped up everywhere. I would scroll through my feed and I would see a baby announcement photo. I'd see an ad for a product I had just whispered to a friend about yesterday. I would see a video of a police officer gunning down someone who looked just like me. And I'd see a think piece about how millennials have replaced sex with avocado toast. (Laughter) It was a confusing time. Those stories kept popping up, but in 2018, those stories got changed out for a different type of story, stories like, ""White Woman Calls Cops On Black Woman Waiting For An Uber."" That was Brooklyn Becky. Then there was, ""White Woman Calls Police On Eight-Year-Old Black Girl Selling Water."" That was Permit Patty. Then there was, ""Woman Calls Police On Black Family BBQing At Lake In Oakland."" That was now infamous BBQ Becky. And I contend that these stories of living while black are actually progress. We used to find out after the extrajudicial police killings. Now, we're getting video of people calling 911. We're moving upstream, closer to the problem and closer to the solution. So I started a collection of as many of these stories as I could find. I built an evolving, still-growing database at baratunde.com/livingwhileblack. Seeking understanding, I realized the process was really diagramming sentences to understand these headlines. And I want to thank my Sidwell English teacher Erica Berry and all English teachers. You have given us tools to fight for our own freedom. What I found was a process to break down the headline and understand the consistent layers in each one: a subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity, so that ""White Woman Calls Police On Eight-Year-Old Black Girl"" is the same as ""White Man Calls Police On Black Woman Using Neighborhood Pool"" is the same as ""Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker Campaigning In Her District."" They're the same. Diagramming the sentences allowed me to diagram the white supremacy which allowed such sentences to be true, and I will pause to define my terms. When I say ""white supremacy,"" I'm not just talking about Nazis or white power activists, and I'm definitely not saying that all white people are racist. What I'm referring to is a system of structural advantage that favors white people over others in social, economic and political arenas. It's what Bryan Stevenson at the Equal Justice Initiative calls the narrative of racial difference, the story we told ourselves to justify slavery and Jim Crow and mass incarceration and beyond. So when I saw this pattern repeating, I got angry, but I also got inspired to create a game, a game of words that would allow me to transform this traumatic exposure into more of a healing experience. I'm going to talk you through the game. The first level is a training level, and I need your participation. Our objective: to determine if this is real or fake. Did this happen or not? Here is the example: ""Catholic University Law Librarian Calls Police On Student For 'Being Argumentative.'"" Clap your hands if you think this is real. (Applause) Clap your hands if you think this is fake. (Applause) The reals have it, unfortunately, and a point of information, being argumentative in a law library is the exact right place to do that. (Laughter) This student should be promoted to professor. Training level complete, so we move on to the real levels. Level one, our objective is simple: reverse the roles. That means ""Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker"" becomes ""Black Oregon Lawmaker Calls Cops On Woman."" That means ""White Man Calls Police On Black Woman Using Neighborhood Pool"" becomes ""Black Woman Calls Police On White Man Using Neighborhood Pool."" How do you like them reverse racist apples? That's it, level one complete, and so we level up to level two, where our objective is to increase the believability of the reversal. Let's face it, a black woman calling police on a white man using a pool isn't absurd enough, but what if that white man was trying to touch her hair without asking, or maybe he was making oat milk while riding a unicycle, or maybe he's just talking over everyone in a meeting. (Laughter) We've all been there, right? Seriously, we've all been there. So that's it, level two complete. But it comes with a warning: simply reversing the flow of injustice is not justice. That is vengeance, that is not our mission, that's a different game so we level up to level three, where the objective is to change the action, also known as ""calling the police is not your only option OMG, what is wrong with you people!"" (Applause) And I need to pause the game to remind us of the structure. A subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity. ""White Woman Calls Police On Black Real Estate Investor Inspecting His Own Property."" ""California Safeway Calls Cops On Black Woman Donating Food To The Homeless."" ""Gold Club Twice Calls Cops On Black Women For Playing Too Slow."" In all these cases, the subject is usually white, the target is usually black, and the activities are anything, from sitting in a Starbucks to using the wrong type of barbecue to napping to walking ""agitated"" on the way to work, which I just call ""walking to work."" (Laughter) And, my personal favorite, not stopping his dog from humping her dog, which is clearly a case for dog police, not people police. All of these activities add up to living. Our existence is being interpreted as crime. Now, this is the obligatory moment in the presentation where I have to say, not everything is about race. Crime is a thing, should be reported, but ask yourself, do we need armed men to show up and resolve this situation, because when they show up for me, it's different. We know that police officers use force more with black people than with white people, and we are learning the role of 911 calls in this. Thanks to preliminary research from the Center for Policing Equity, we're learning that in some cities, most of the interactions between cops and citizens is due to 911 calls, not officer-initiated stops, and most of the violence, the use of force by police on citizens, is in response to those calls. Further, when those officers responding to calls use force, that increases in areas where the percentage of the white population has also increased, aka gentrification, aka unicycles and oat milk, aka when BBQ Becky feels threatened, she becomes a threat to me in my own neighborhood, which forces me and people like me to police ourselves. We quiet ourselves, we walk on eggshells, we maybe pull over to the side of the road under the brightest light we can find so that our murder might be caught cleanly on camera, and we do this because we live in a system in which white people can too easily call on deadly force to ensure their comfort. (Applause) The California Safeway didn't just call cops on black woman donating food to homeless. They ordered armed, unaccountable men upon her. They essentially called in a drone strike. This is weaponized discomfort, and it is not new. From 1877 to 1950, there were at least 4,400 documented racial terror lynchings of black people in the United States. They had headlines as well. ""Rev. T.A. Allen was lynched in Hernando, Mississippi for organizing local sharecroppers."" ""Oliver Moore was lynched in Edgecomb County, North Carolina, for frightening a white girl."" ""Nathan Bird was lynched near Luling, Texas, for refusing to turn his son over to a mob."" We need to change the action, whether that action is ""lynches"" or ""calls police."" And now that I have shortened the distance between those two, let's get back to our game, to our mission. Our objective in level three is to change the action. So what if, instead of ""Calls Cops On Black Woman Donating Food To Homeless,"" that California Safeway simply thanks her. Thanking is far cheaper than bringing law enforcement to the scene. (Applause) Or, instead, they could give the food they would have wasted to her, upped their civic cred. Or, the white woman who called the police on the eight-year-old black girl, she could have bought all the inventory from that little black girl, support a small business. And the white woman who called the police on the black real estate investor, we would all be better off, the cops agree, if she had simply ignored him and minded her own damn business. (Laughter) Minding one's own damn business is an excellent choice, excellent choice. Choose it more often. Level three is complete, but there is a final bonus level, where the objective is inclusion. We have also seen headlines like this: ""Powerful Man Masturbates In Front Of Young Women Visiting His Office."" What an odd choice for powerful man to make. So many other actions available to him. (Laughter) Like, such as, ""listens to,"" ""mentors,"" ""inspired by, starts joint venture, everybody rich now."" (Laughter) I want to live in that world of everybody rich now, but because of his poor choice, we are all in a poorer world. Doesn't have to be this way. This word game reminded me that there is a structure to white supremacy, as there is to misogyny, as there is to all systemic abuses of power. Structure is what makes them systemic. I'm asking people here to see the structure, where the power is in it, and even more importantly to see the humanity of those of us made targets by this structure. I am here because I was loved and invested in and protected and lucky, because I went to the right schools, I'm semifamous, mostly happy, meditate twice a day, and yet, I walk around in fear, because I know that someone seeing me as a threat can become a threat to my life, and I am tired. I am tired of carrying this invisible burden of other people's fears, and many of us are, and we shouldn't have to, because we can change this, because we can change the action, which changes the story, which changes the system that allows those stories to happen. Systems are just collective stories we all buy into. When we change them, we write a better reality for us all to be a part of. I am asking us to use our power to choose. I am asking us to level up. Thank you. I am Baratunde Rafiq Thurston. (Applause)"
5:02,Lillian Faderman,Harvey Milk's radical vision of equality,Mar 2019,"By 1973, Harvey Milk had already been many things: naval officer, high school teacher, bit-part actor, and wandering hippie. But as he embarked on yet another life  running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings  on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need  for political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit  neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those  community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting  up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture  of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal  approach to local government. This philosophy led him to run  for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative  for his own district, which included the heart of  American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality,  discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as  political outsiders. But Milk refused to  downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never  be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without  representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these  basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised  groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for  the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California  Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued  to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction  unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title,  the ""mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for  the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay  public officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined  to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy  with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national  momentum, especially in the form of  California’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought  to make it illegal for homosexuals to work  in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle  of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked  the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends,  if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors,  to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign  against hate. On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was  gaining traction. But just twenty days after this  inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco  Mayor George Moscone. Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those  he called ""radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey  at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change  which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk's murder, thousands marched by candlelight  through the city. In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven  years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar  throughout the city in what became known as  the White Night Riots. But even after his death, Milk continued to preach  his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total  of three different tapes to be played in the event  of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome in the fight against injustice: ""I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy  every closet door…”"
4:34,Michelle Mehrtens,The historic women's suffrage march on Washington,Mar 2019,"On March 3, 1913, protesters parted for the woman in white: dressed in a flowing cape and  sitting astride a white horse, the activist Inez Milholland was  hard to miss. She was riding at the helm of the  Women’s Suffrage Parade- the first mass protest for a woman’s  right to vote on a national scale. After months of strategic planning  and controversy, thousands of women gathered  in Washington D.C. Here, they called for a constitutional  amendment granting them the right to vote. By 1913, women’s rights activists had  been campaigning for decades. As a disenfranchised group, women had no voice in the laws that  affected their– or anyone else’s– lives. However, they were struggling to secure  broader support for political equality. They’d achieved no major victories  since 1896, when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women. That brought the total number of states which recognized a women’s right to vote to four. A new, media-savvy spirit arrived  in the form of Alice Paul. She was inspired by the British  suffragettes, who went on hunger strikes and endured imprisonment in the early 1900s. Rather than conduct costly campaigns  on a state-by-state basis, Paul sought the long-lasting impact  of a constitutional amendment, which would protect women’s voting  rights nationwide. As a member of the National American  Women Suffrage Association, Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip  up support and rejuvenate the movement. Washington authorities initially  rejected her plan- and then tried to relegate the march  to side streets. But Paul got those decisions overturned and confirmed a parade for the day  before the presidential inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. This would maximize media coverage and grab the attention of the  crowds who would be in town. However, in planning the parade, Paul mainly focused on appealing to  white women from all backgrounds, including those who were racist. She actively discouraged African  American activists and organizations from participating- and stated that those who did so  should march in the back. But black women would not be  made invisible in a national movement they helped shape. On the day of the march, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a ground-breaking investigative journalist and anti-lynching advocate, refused to move to the back and  proudly marched under the Illinois banner. The co-founder of the NAACP,  Mary Church Terrell, joined the parade with the 22 founders  of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, an organization created by female  students from Howard University. In these ways and more, black women persevered  despite deep hostility from white women in the movement, and at great political and physical risk. On the day of the parade, suffragists assembled to create a  powerful exhibition. The surging sections of the procession  included international suffragists, artists, performers and business-owners. Floats came in the form of golden  chariots; an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map  of enfranchised countries. On the steps of the Treasury Building, performers acted out the historical  achievements of women to a live orchestra. The marchers carried on even as a  mob blocked the route, hurling insults and spitting at women,   tossing cigars, and physically  assaulting participants. The police did not intervene, and in the end,  over 100 women were hospitalized. Their mistreatment, widely reported  throughout the country, catapulted the parade into the public eye—  and garnered suffragists greater sympathy. National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated  their actions during the parade. After the protest, the ""Women’s Journal""  declared, “Washington has been disgraced. Equal  suffrage has scored a great victory."" In this way, the march initiated a surge of support for women’s voting rights that endured in the coming years. Suffragists kept up steady pressure  on their representatives, attended rallies, and petitioned  the White House. Inez Milholland, the woman on  the white horse, campaigned constantly throughout  the United States, despite suffering from chronic  health problems. She did not live to see her efforts  come to fruition. In 1916, she collapsed while giving a  suffrage speech and died soon after. According to popular reports, her last words were, “Mr. President, how long must women  wait for liberty?” Though full voting inclusion  would take decades, in 1920, Congress ratified the  19th amendment, finally granting women the right to vote."
11:28,Ronald Rael,An architect's subversive reimagining of the US-Mexico border wall,Feb 2019,"Isn't it fascinating how the simple act of drawing a line on the map can transform the way we see and experience the world? And how those spaces in between lines, borders, become places. They become places where language and food and music and people of different cultures rub up against each other in beautiful and sometimes violent and occasionally really ridiculous ways. And those lines drawn on a map can actually create scars in the landscape, and they can create scars in our memories. My interest in borders came about when I was searching for an architecture of the borderlands. And I was working on several projects along the US-Mexico border, designing buildings made out of mud taken right from the ground. And I also work on projects that you might say immigrated to this landscape. ""Prada Marfa,"" a land-art sculpture that crosses the border between art and architecture, and it demonstrated to me that architecture could communicate ideas that are much more politically and culturally complex, that architecture could be satirical and serious at the same time and it could speak to the disparities between wealth and poverty and what's local and what's foreign. And so in my search for an architecture of the borderlands, I began to wonder, is the wall architecture? I began to document my thoughts and visits to the wall by creating a series of souvenirs to remind us of the time when we built a wall and what a crazy idea that was. I created border games, (Laughter) postcards, snow globes with little architectural models inside of them, and maps that told the story of resilience at the wall and sought for ways that design could bring to light the problems that the border wall was creating. So, is the wall architecture? Well, it certainly is a design structure, and it's designed at a research facility called FenceLab, where they would load vehicles with 10,000 pounds and ram them into the wall at 40 miles an hour to test the wall's impermeability. But there was also counter-research going on on the other side, the design of portable drawbridges that you could bring right up to the wall and allow vehicles to drive right over. (Laughter) And like with all research projects, there are successes and there are failures. (Laughter) But it's these medieval reactions to the wall -- drawbridges, for example -- that are because the wall itself is an arcane, medieval form of architecture. It's an overly simplistic response to a complex set of issues. And a number of medieval technologies have sprung up along the wall: catapults that launch bales of marijuana over the wall (Laughter) or cannons that shoot packets of cocaine and heroin over the wall. Now during medieval times, diseased, dead bodies were sometimes catapulted over walls as an early form of biological warfare, and it's speculated that today, humans are being propelled over the wall as a form of immigration. A ridiculous idea. But the only person ever known to be documented to have launched over the wall from Mexico to the United States was in fact a US citizen, who was given permission to human-cannonball over the wall, 200 feet, so long as he carried his passport in hand (Laughter) and he landed safely in a net on the other side. And my thoughts are inspired by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy, who said, ""Architects do not design walls, but the spaces between them."" So while I do not think that architects should be designing walls, I do think it's important and urgent that they should be paying attention to those spaces in between. They should be designing for the places and the people, the landscapes that the wall endangers. Now, people are already rising to this occasion, and while the purpose of the wall is to keep people apart and away, it's actually bringing people together in some really remarkable ways, holding social events like binational yoga classes along the border, to bring people together across the divide. I call this the monument pose. (Laughter) And have you ever heard of ""wall y ball""? (Laughter) It's a borderland version of volleyball, and it's been played since 1979 (Laughter) along the US-Mexico border to celebrate binational heritage. And it raises some interesting questions, right? Is such a game even legal? Does hitting a ball back and forth over the wall constitute illegal trade? (Laughter) The beauty of volleyball is that it transforms the wall into nothing more than a line in the sand negotiated by the minds and bodies and spirits of players on both sides. And I think it's exactly these kinds of two-sided negotiations that are needed to bring down walls that divide. Now, throwing the ball over the wall is one thing, but throwing rocks over the wall has caused damage to Border Patrol vehicles and have injured Border Patrol agents, and the response from the US side has been drastic. Border Patrol agents have fired through the wall, killing people throwing rocks on the Mexican side. And another response by Border Patrol agents is to erect baseball backstops to protect themselves and their vehicles. And these backstops became a permanent feature in the construction of new walls. And I began to wonder if, like volleyball, maybe baseball should be a permanent feature at the border, and walls could start opening up, allowing communities to come across and play, and if they hit a home run, maybe a Border Patrol agent would pick up the ball and throw it back over to the other side. A Border Patrol agent buys a raspado, a frozen treat, from a vendor just a couple feet away, food and money is exchanged through the wall, an entirely normal event made illegal by that line drawn on a map and a couple millimeters of steel. And this scene reminded me of a saying: ""If you have more than you need, you should build longer tables and not higher walls."" So I created this souvenir to remember the moment that we could share food and conversation across the divide. A swing allows one to enter and swing over to the other side until gravity deports them back to their own country. The border and the border wall is thought of as a sort of political theater today, so perhaps we should invite audiences to that theater, to a binational theater where people can come together with performers, musicians. Maybe the wall is nothing more than an enormous instrument, the world's largest xylophone, and we could play down this wall with weapons of mass percussion. (Laughter) When I envisioned this binational library, I wanted to imagine a space where one could share books and information and knowledge across a divide, where the wall was nothing more than a bookshelf. And perhaps the best way to illustrate the mutual relationship that we have with Mexico and the United States is by imagining a teeter-totter, where the actions on one side had a direct consequence on what happens on the other side, because you see, the border itself is both a symbolic and literal fulcrum for US-Mexico relations, and building walls between neighbors severs those relationships. You probably remember this quote, ""Good fences make good neighbors."" It's often thought of as the moral of Robert Frost's poem ""Mending Wall."" But the poem is really about questioning the need for building walls at all. It's really a poem about mending human relationships. My favorite line is the first one: ""Something there is that doesn't love a wall."" Because if there's one thing that's clear to me -- there are not two sides defined by a wall. This is one landscape, divided. On one side, it might look like this. A man is mowing his lawn while the wall is looming in his backyard. And on the other side, it might look like this. The wall is the fourth wall of someone's house. But the reality is that the wall is cutting through people's lives. It is cutting through our private property, our public lands, our Native American lands, our cities, a university, our neighborhoods. And I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if the wall cut through a house. Remember those disparities between wealth and poverty? On the right is the average size of a house in El Paso, Texas, and on the left is the average size of a house in Juarez. And here, the wall cuts directly through the kitchen table. And here, the wall cuts through the bed in the bedroom. Because I wanted to communicate how the wall is not only dividing places, it's dividing people, it's dividing families. And the unfortunate politics of the wall is today, it is dividing children from their parents. You might be familiar with this well-known traffic sign. It was designed by graphic designer John Hood, a Native American war veteran working for the California Department of Transportation. And he was tasked with creating a sign to warn motorists of immigrants who were stranded alongside the highway and who might attempt to run across the road. Hood related the plight of the immigrant today to that of the Navajo during the Long Walk. And this is really a brilliant piece of design activism. And he was very careful in thinking about using a little girl with pigtails, for example, because he thought that's who motorists might empathize with the most, and he used the silhouette of the civil rights leader Cesar Chavez to create the head of the father. I wanted to build upon the brilliance of this sign to call attention to the problem of child separation at the border, and I made one very simple move. I turned the families to face each other. And in the last few weeks, I've had the opportunity to bring that sign back to the highway to tell a story, the story of the relationships that we should be mending and a reminder that we should be designing a reunited states and not a divided states. Thank you. (Applause)"
7:04,Jeanne Pinder,What if all US health care costs were transparent?,Feb 2019,"So, a little while ago, members of my family had three bits of minor surgery, about a half hour each, and we got three sets of bills. For the first one, the anesthesia bill alone was 2,000 dollars; the second one, 2,000 dollars; the third one, 6,000 dollars. So I'm a journalist. I'm like, what's up with that? I found out that I was actually, for the expensive one, being charged 1,419 dollars for a generic anti-nausea drug that I could buy online for two dollars and forty-nine cents. I had a long and unsatisfactory argument with the hospital, the insurer and my employer. Everybody agreed that this was totally fine. But it got me thinking, and the more I talked to people, the more I realized: nobody has any idea what stuff costs in health care. Not before, during or after that procedure or test do you have any idea what it's going to cost. It's only months later that you get an ""explanation of benefits"" that explains exactly nothing. So this came back to me a little while later. I had volunteered for a buyout from the New York Times, where I had worked for more than 20 years as a journalist. I was looking for my next act. It turned out that next act was to build a company telling people what stuff costs in health care. I won a ""Shark Tank""-type pitch contest to do just that. Health costs ate up almost 18 percent of our gross domestic product last year, but nobody has any idea what stuff costs. But what if we did know? So we started out small. We called doctors and hospitals and asked them what they would accept as a cash payment for simple procedures. Some people were helpful. A lot of people hung up on us. Some people were just plain rude. They said, ""We don't know,"" or, ""Our lawyers won't let us tell you that,"" though we did get a lot of information. We found, for example, that here in the New York area, you could get an echocardiogram for 200 dollars in Brooklyn or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan, just a few miles away. New Orleans, the same simple blood test, 19 dollars over here, 522 dollars just a few blocks away. San Francisco, the same MRI, 475 dollars or 6,221 dollars just 25 miles away. These pricing variations existed for all the procedures and all the cities that we surveyed. Then we started to ask people to tell us their health bills. In partnership with public radio station WNYC here in New York, we asked women to tell us the prices of their mammograms. People told us nobody would do that, that it was too personal. But in the space of three weeks, 400 women told us about their prices. Then we started to make it easier for people to share their data into our online searchable database. It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak.com and the Waze traffic app for health care. (Laughter) We call it a community-created guide to health costs. Our survey and crowdsourcing work grew into partnerships with top newsrooms nationwide -- in New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and other places. We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering and how to avoid that suffering, to avoid that ""gotcha"" bill. A woman in New Orleans saved nearly 4,000 dollars using our data. A San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars by putting away his insurance card and paying cash. There are a lot of people who are going to in-network hospitals and getting out-of-network bills. And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man. We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices. They want to learn what stuff costs, find out how to argue a bill, help us solve this problem that's hurting them and their friends and families. We talked to people who had to sell a car to pay a health bill, go into bankruptcy, skip a treatment because of the cost. Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis but not the cure. We set off a huge conversation about costs involving doctors and hospitals, yes, but also their patients, or as we like to call them, people. (Laughter) We changed policy. A consumer protection bill that had been stalled in the Louisiana legislature for 10 years passed after we launched. Let's face it: this huge, slow-rolling public health crisis is a national emergency. And I don't think government's going to help us out anytime soon. But what if the answer was really simple: make all the prices public all the time. Would our individual bills go down? Our health premiums? Be really clear about this: this is a United States problem. In most of the rest of the developed world, sick people don't have to worry about money. It's also true that price transparency will not solve every problem. There will still be expensive treatments, huge friction from our insurance system. There will still be fraud and a massive problem with overtreatment and overdiagnosis. And not everything is shoppable. Not everybody wants the cheapest appendectomy or the cheapest cancer care. But when we talk about these clear effects, we're looking at a real issue that's actually very simple. When we first started calling for prices, we actually felt like we were going to be arrested. It seemed kind of transgressive to talk about medicine and health care in the same breath, and yet it became liberating, because we found not only data but also good and honest people out there in the system who want to help folks get the care they need at a price they can afford. And it got easier to ask. So I'll leave you with some questions. What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance? What if, every time you Googled for an MRI, you got drop-downs telling you where to buy and for how much, the way you do when you Google for a laser printer? What if all of the time and energy and money that's spent hiding prices was squeezed out of the system? What if each one of us could pick the $19 test every time instead of the $522 one? Would our individual bills go down? Our premiums? I don't know, but if you don't ask, you'll never know. And you might save a ton of money. And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself would be a lot healthier. Thank you. (Applause)"
10:21,P.J. Parmar,How doctors can help low-income patients (and still make a profit),Feb 2019,"Colfax Avenue, here in Denver, Colorado, was once called the longest, wickedest street in America. My office is there in the same place -- it's a medical desert. There are government clinics and hospitals nearby, but they're not enough to handle the poor who live in the area. By poor, I mean those who are on Medicaid. Not just for the homeless; 20 percent of this country is on Medicaid. If your neighbors have a family of four and make less than $33,000 a year, then they can get Medicaid. But they can't find a doctor to see them. A study by Merritt Hawkins found that only 20 percent of the family doctors in Denver take any Medicaid patients. And of those 20 percent, some have caps, like five Medicaid patients a month. Others make Medicaid patients wait months to be seen, but will see you today, if you have Blue Cross. This form of classist discrimination is legal and is not just a problem in Denver. Almost half the family doctors in the country refuse to see Medicaid patients. Why? Well, because Medicaid pays less than private insurance and because Medicaid patients are seen as more challenging. Some show up late for appointments, some don't speak English and some have trouble following instructions. I thought about this while in medical school. If I could design a practice that caters to low-income folks instead of avoiding them, then I would have guaranteed customers and very little competition. (Laughter) So after residency, I opened up shop, doing underserved medicine. Not as a nonprofit, but as a private practice. A small business seeing only resettled refugees. That was six years ago, and since then, we've served 50,000 refugee medical visits. (Applause) Ninety percent of our patients have Medicaid, and most of the rest, we see for free. Most doctors say you can't make money on Medicaid, but we're doing it just fine. How? Well, if this were real capitalism, then I wouldn't tell you, because you'd become my competition. (Laughter) But I call this ""bleeding-heart"" capitalism. (Laughter) And we need more people doing this, not less, so here's how. We break down the walls of our medical maze by taking the challenges of Medicaid patients, turning them into opportunities, and pocketing the difference. The nuts and bolts may seem simple, but they add up. For example, we have no appointments. We're walk-in only. Of course, that's how it works at the emergency room, at urgent cares and at Taco Bell. (Laughter) But not usually at family doctor's offices. Why do we do it? Because Nasra can't call for an appointment. She has a phone, but she doesn't have phone minutes. She can't speak English, and she can't navigate a phone tree. And she can't show up on time for an appointment because she doesn't have a car, she takes the bus, and she takes care of three kids plus her disabled father. So we have no appointments; she shows up when she wants, but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen. She then spends as much time with us as she needs. Sometimes that's 40 minutes, usually it's less than five. She loves this flexibility. It's how she saw doctors in Somalia. And I love it, because I don't pay staff to do scheduling, and we have a zero no-show rate and a zero late-show rate. (Laughter) (Applause) It makes business sense. Another difference is our office layout. Our exam rooms open right to the waiting room, our medical providers room their own patients, and our providers stay in one room instead of alternating between rooms. Cutting steps cuts costs and increases customer satisfaction. We also hand out free medicines, right from our exam room: over-the-counter ones and some prescription ones, too. If Nasra's baby is sick, we put a bottle of children's Tylenol or amoxicillin right in her hand. She can take that baby straight back home instead of stopping at the pharmacy. I don't know about you, but I get sick just looking at all those choices. Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there. We also text patients. We're open evenings and weekends. We do home visits. We've jumped dead car batteries. (Laughter) With customer satisfaction so high, we've never had to advertise, yet are growing at 25 percent a year. And we've become real good at working with Medicaid, since it's pretty much the only insurance company we deal with. Other doctor's offices chase 10 insurance companies just to make ends meet. That's just draining. A single-payer system is like monogamy: it just works better. (Laughter) (Applause) Of course, Medicaid is funded by tax payers like you, so you might be wondering, ""How much does this cost the system?"" Well, we're cheaper than the alternatives. Some of our patients might go to the emergency room, which can cost thousands, just for a simple cold. Some may stay home and let their problems get worse. But most would try to make an appointment at a clinic that's part of the system called the Federally Qualified Health Centers. This is a nationwide network of safety-net clinics that receive twice as much government funding per visit than private doctors like me. Not only they get more money, but by law, there can only be one in each area. That means they have a monopoly on special funding for the poor. And like any monopoly, there's a tendency for cost to go up and quality to go down. I'm not a government entity; I'm not a nonprofit. I'm a private practice. I have a capitalist drive to innovate. I have to be fast and friendly. I have to be cost-effective and culturally sensitive. I have to be tall, dark and handsome. (Laughter) (Applause) And if I'm not, I'm going out of business. I can innovate faster than a nonprofit, because I don't need a meeting to move a stapler. (Applause) Really, none of our innovations are new or unique -- we just put them together in a unique way to help low-income folks while making money. And then, instead of taking that money home, I put it back into the refugee community as a business expense. This is Mango House. My version of a medical home. In it, we have programs to feed and clothe the poor, an after-school program, English classes, churches, dentist, legal help, mental health and the scout groups. These programs are run by tenant organizations and amazing staff, but all receive some amount of funding form profits from my clinic. Some call this social entrepreneurship. I call it social-service arbitrage. Exploiting inefficiencies in our health care system to serve the poor. We're serving 15,000 refugees a year at less cost than where else they would be going. Of course, there's downsides to doing this as a private business, rather than as a nonprofit or a government entity. There's taxes and legal exposures. There's changing Medicaid rates and specialists who don't take Medicaid. And there's bomb threats. Notice there's no apostrophes, it's like, ""We were going to blow up all you refugees!"" (Laughter) ""We were going to blow up all you refugees, but then we went to your English class, instead."" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, you might be thinking, ""This guy's a bit different."" (Laughter) Uncommon. (Laughter) A communal narcissist? (Laughter) A unicorn, maybe, because if this was so easy, then other doctors would be doing it. Well, based on Medicaid rates, you can do this in most of the country. You can be your own boss, help the poor and make good money doing it. Medical folks, you wrote on your school application essays that you wanted to help those less fortunate. But then you had your idealism beaten out of you in training. Your creativity bred out of you. It doesn't have to be that way. You can choose underserved medicine as a lifestyle specialty. Or you can be a specialist who cuts cost in order to see low-income folks. And for the rest of you, who don't work in health care, what did you write on your applications? Most of us wanted to save the world, to make a difference. Maybe you've been successful in your career but are now looking for that meaning? How can you get there? I don't just mean giving a few dollars or a few hours; I mean how can you use your expertise to innovate new ways of serving others. It might be easier than you think. The only way we're going to bridge the underserved medicine gap is by seeing it as a business opportunity. The only way we're going to bridge the inequality gap is by recognizing our privileges and using them to help others. (Applause)"
20:28,Ruby Sales,How we can start to heal the pain of racial division,Feb 2019,"I want to share with you a moment in my life when the hurt and wounds of racism were both deadly and paralyzing for me. And I think what I've learned can be a source of healing for all of us. When I was 17 years old, I was a college student at Tuskegee University, and I was a worker in the Southern freedom movement, which we call the Civil Rights Movement. During this time, I met another young 26-year-old, white seminary and college student named Jonathan Daniels, from Cambridge, Massachusetts. He and I were both part of a generation of idealistic young people, whose life has been ignited by the freedom fire that ordinary black people were spreading around the nation and throughout the South. We had come to Lowndes County to work in the movement. And it was a nonviolent movement to redeem the souls of America. We believe that everyone, both black and white, people in the South, could find a redemptive pathway out of the stranglehold of racism that had gripped them for more than 400 years. And on a hot, summer day in August, Jonathan and I joined a demonstration of local young black people, who were protesting the exploitation [of] black sharecroppers by rich land holders who cheated them out of their money. We decided to demonstrate alongside them. And on the morning that we showed up for the demonstration, we were met with a mob of howling white men with baseball bats, shotguns and any weapon that you could imagine. And they were threatening to kill us. And the sheriff, seeing the danger that we faced, arrested us and put us on a garbage truck and took us to the local jail, where we were put in cells with the most inhumane conditions you can imagine. And we were threatened by the jailers with drinking water that came from toilets. We were finally released on the sixth day, without any knowledge, without any forewarning. Just out of the clear blue sky, we were made to leave. And we knew that this was a dangerous sign, because Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney had also been forced to leave jail and were murdered because no one knew what had happened to them. And so, despite our fervent resistance, the sheriff made us leave the jail, and of course, nobody was waiting for us. It was hot, one of those Southern days where you could literally feel the pavement -- the vapor seeping out of the pavement. And the group of about 14 of us selected Jonathan Daniels, Father Morrisroe, who had recently come to the county, Joyce Bailey, a local 17-year-old girl and I to go and get the drinks. When we got to the door, a white man was standing in the doorway with a shotgun, and he said, ""Bitch, I'll blow your brains out!"" And before I could even react, before I could even process what was going on, Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse, and I fell back, thinking that I was dead. And in that instant, when I looked up, Jonathan Daniels was standing in the line of fire, and he took the blast, and he saved my life. I was so traumatized and paralyzed by that event, where Tom Coleman deliberately, with malicious intent, killed my beloved friend and colleague, Jonathan Myrick Daniels. On that day, which was one of the most important days in my life, I saw both love and hate coming from two very different white men that represented the best and the worst of white America. So deep was my hurt at seeing Tom Coleman murder Jonathan before my eyes, that I became a silent person, and I did not speak for six months. I finally learned to touch that hurt in me as I became older and began to talk about the Southern freedom movement, and began to connect my stories with the stories of my other colleagues and freedom fighters, who, like me, had faced deadly trauma of racism, and who had lost friends along the way, and who themselves have been beaten and thrown in jail. It is 50 years later. Many people were beaten and thrown in jail. Others were murdered like Jonathan Daniels. And yet, we are still, as a nation, mired down in the quicksand of racism. And everywhere I go around the nation, I see and hear the hurt. And I ask people everywhere, ""Tell me, where does it hurt?"" Do you see and feel the hurt that I see and feel? I feel and see the hurt in black and brown people who every day feel the vicious volley of racism and every day have their civil and human rights stripped away. And the people who do this use stereotypes and myths to justify doing it. Everywhere I go, I see and hear women who speak out against -- who speak out against men who invade our bodies. These same men who then turn around -- the same men who promote racism and then turn around and steal our labor and pay us unequal wages. I hear and feel the hurt of white men at the betrayal by the same powerful white men who tell them that their skin color is their ticket to a good life and power, only to discover, as the circle of whiteness narrows, that their tickets have expired and no longer carry first-class status. Now that we've touched the hurt, we must ask ourselves, ""Where does it hurt and what is the source of the hurt?"" I propose that we must look deeply into the culture of whiteness. That is a river that drowns out all of our identities and drowns us in false uniformity to protect the status quo. Notice, everybody, I said culture of whiteness, and not white people. Because in my estimation, the problem is not white people. Instead, it is the culture of whiteness. And by culture of whiteness, I mean a systemic and organized set of beliefs, values, canonized knowledge and even religion, to maintain a hierarchical, over-and-against power structure based on skin color, against people of color. It is a culture where white people are seen as necessary and friendly insiders, while people of color, especially black people, are seen as dangerous and threatening outsiders, who pose a clear and present danger to the safety and the efficacy of the culture of whiteness. Listen to me and see if you can imagine the culture of whiteness as a dehumanizing process that melts away all of our multiple and interlocking identities, such as race, class, gender and sexualities, so that ... so that unity is maintained for power. I believe, because I know and believe that the culture of whiteness is a social construct. Each of us, from birth to death, are socialized in this culture. And it marks people of color also. And it makes people of color, like white people, vote against our interests. Some of you might ask -- and my students always tell me I give hard assignments -- some of you might ask, and rightfully so, ""How do we fix this? It seems so all-powerful and overwhelming."" I believe that we must fix it, because we cannot humanize our future if we continue to be complicit with the culture of whiteness. Each of us must connect with our authentic selves, with our authentic ethnic selves. And we must connect with the other aspects of our identities. And we must move out of the constructs of whiteness, brownness and blackness to become who we are at our fullest. How do we do this? I believe that we do this through our collective narratives. And our collective narratives must contain our individual stories, the arts, spiritual reflections, literature, and yes, even drumming. (Laughter) It must be a collective telling, because individual stories just create a paradigm where we are pitting one story against another story. These different models that I have talked about tonight I think are essential to providing us a pathway out of the quagmire of racism. And I want to talk about another very important model. And that is redemption. I believe that movements for racial justice must be redemptive rather than punitive. And yes, I believe that we must provide the possibility of redemption for everyone. And we must be willing, despite some of the vitriolic language that might come from those very people who oppress us, I think that we must listen to them and try to figure out where do they hurt. We must do this, I believe, because our redemption is tied into their redemption, And we will not be free until we've all been redeemed from unredemptive anger. The challenge is not easy. And in a technological society, it grows even more complicated, because often we use technologies to perpetuate the very values of racism that we indulge in every day. We use technology to bully, to perpetuate hate speech and to degrade each other's humanities. And so I believe that if we're going to humanize the future, we must design ways to use technology not to degrade us, but to elevate us so that we can live into the fullest of our capacities. And I believe that technology must provide us larger vistas so that we might engage with each other and move beyond the segregated spaces that we live in, every day of our lives. I believe that we can achieve this if we set our minds and hopes on the prize. The question before us tonight is very serious. It is: ""Do you want to be healed? Do you want to be healed?"" Do you want to become whole and live into all of your identities? Or do you want to continue to cannibalize your multiple identities and privilege one identity over the other? Do you want to join a long line of generations of people who believed in the promise of America and had the faith to upbuild democracy? Do you want to live into the fullest of your potential? I certainly do. And I believe you do, too. Let me just say, quite seriously, I believe in you. And despite everything, I still believe in America. I hope that this offering that I've given to you tonight, that I've shared with you tonight, will provide redemptive pathways so that you might claim the fullest of your identity and become a major participant in humanizing not only the future for yourselves, but also for our democracy. Thank you. (Applause)"
15:09,Marian Wright Edelman,Reflections from a lifetime fighting to end child poverty,Jan 2019,"Pat Mitchell: I know you don't like that ""legend"" business. Marian Wright Edelman: I don't. (Laughter) PM: Why not, Marian? Because you are somewhat of a legend. You've been doing this for a long time, and you're still there as founder and president. MWE: Well, because my daddy raised us and my mother raised us to serve, and we are servant-leaders. And it is not about external things or labels, and I feel like the luckiest person in the world having been born at the intersection of great needs and great injustices and great opportunities to change them. So I just feel very grateful that I could serve and make a difference. PM: What a beautiful way of saying it. (Applause) You grew up in the American South, and like all children, a lot of who you became was molded by your parents. Tell me: What did they teach you about movement-building? MWE: I had extraordinary parents. I was so lucky. My mother was the best organizer I ever knew. And she always insisted, even back then, on having her own dime. She started her dairy so that she could have her penny, and that sense of independence has certainly been passed on to me. My daddy was a minister, and they were real partners. And my oldest sibling is a sister, I'm the youngest, and there are three boys in between. But I always knew I was as smart as my brothers. I always was a tomboy. I always had the same high aspirations that they had. But most importantly, we were terribly blessed, even though we were growing up in a very segregated small town in South Carolina -- we knew it was wrong. I always knew, from the time I was four years old, that I wasn't going to accept being put into slots. But Daddy and Mama always had the sense that it was not us, it was the outside world, but you have the capacity to grow up to change it, and I began to do that very early on. But most importantly, they were the best role models, because they said: if you see a need, don't ask why somebody doesn't do it. See what you can do. There was no home for the aged in our hometown. And Reverend Reddick, who had what we know now, 50 years later, as Alzheimer's, and he began to wander the streets. And so Daddy and Mama figured out he needed a place to go, so we started a home for the aged. Children had to cook and clean and serve. We didn't like it at the time, but that's how we learned that it was our obligation to take care of those who couldn't take care of themselves. I had 12 foster sisters and brothers. My mother took them in after we left home, and she took them in before we left home. And again, whenever you see a need, you try to fulfill it. God runs, Daddy used to say, a full employment economy. (Laughter) And so if you just follow the need, you will never lack for something to do or a real purpose in life. And every issue that the Children's Defense Fund works on today comes out of my childhood in a very personal way. Little Johnny Harrington, who lived three doors down from me, stepped on a nail; he lived with his grandmother, got tetanus, went to the hospital, no tetanus shots, he died. He was 11 years old. I remember that. An accident in front of our highway, turns out to have been two white truck drivers and a migrant family that happened to be black. We all ran out to help. It was in the front of a church, and the ambulance came, saw that the white truck drivers were not injured, saw the black migrant workers were, turned around and left them. I never forgot that. And immunizations was one of the first things I worked on at the Children's Defense Fund to make sure that every child gets immunized against preventable diseases. Unequal schools ... (Applause) Separate and unequal, hand-me-downs from the white schools. But we always had books in our house. Daddy was a great reader. He used to make me read every night with him. I'd have to sit for 15 or 20 minutes. One day I put a ""True Confessions"" inside a ""Life Magazine"" and he asked me to read it out loud. I never read a ""True Confessions"" again. (Laughter) But they were great readers. We always had books before we had a second pair of shoes, and that was very important. And although we had hand-me-down books for the black schools and hand-me-down everythings, it was a great need. He made it clear that reading was the window to the outside world, and so that was a great gift from them. But the reinforced lesson was that God runs a full employment economy, and that if you just follow the need, you will never lack for a purpose in life, and that has been so for me. We had a very segregated small town. I was a rebel from the time I was four or five. I went out to a department store and there was ""white"" and ""black"" water signs, but I didn't know that and didn't pay much attention to that, and I was with one of my Sunday school teachers. I drank out of the wrong water fountain, and she jerked me away, and I didn't know what had happened, and then she explained to me about black and white water. I didn't know that, and after that, I went home, took my little wounded psyche to my parents, and told them what had happened, and said, ""What's wrong with me?"" And they said, ""It wasn't much wrong with you. It's what's wrong with the system."" And I used to go then secretly and switch water signs everywhere I went. (Laughter) And it felt so good. (Applause) PM: There is no question that this legend is a bit of a rebel, and has been for a long time. So you started your work as an attorney and with the Civil Rights Movement, and you worked with Dr. King on the original Poor People's Campaign. And then you made this decision, 45 years ago, to set up a national advocacy campaign for children. Why did you choose that particular service, to children? MWE: Well, because so many of the things that I saw in Mississippi and across the South had to do with children. I saw children with bloated bellies in this country who were close to starvation, who were hungry, who were without clothes, and nobody wanted to believe that there were children who were starving, and that's a slow process. And nobody wanted to listen. Every congressman that would come to Mississippi, I'd say, ""Go see,"" and most of them didn't want to do anything about it. But I saw grinding poverty. The state of Mississippi wanted, during voter registration efforts -- and with outside white kids coming in to help black citizens register to vote -- they wanted everybody to leave the state, so they were trying to starve them out. And they switched from free food commodities to food stamps that cost two dollars. People had no income, and nobody in America wanted to believe that there was anybody in America without any income. Well, I knew hundreds of them, thousands of them. And malnutrition was becoming a big problem. And so one of these days came Dr. King down on a number of things we were fighting to get the Head Start program -- which the state of Mississippi turned down -- refinanced. And he went into a center that the poor community was running without any help, and he saw a teacher carve up an apple for eight or 10 children, and he had to run out, because he was in tears. He couldn't believe it. But only when Robert Kennedy decided he would come -- I had gone to testify about the Head Start program, because they were attacking. And I asked, please, come and see yourself, and when you come and see, see hungry people and see starving children. And they came, and he brought the press, and that began to get the movement going. But they wanted to push all the poor people to go north and to get away from being voters. And I'm proud of Mike Espy. Even though he lost last night, he'll win one of these days. (Applause) But you wouldn't have seen such grinding poverty, and the outside white kids who'd come in to help register voters in the 1964 Summer Project where we lost those three young men. But once they left, the press left, and there was just massive need, and people were trying to push the poor out. And so, you know, Head Start came, and we applied for it, because the state turned it down. And that's true of a lot of states that don't take Medicaid these days. And we ran the largest Head Start program in the nation, and it changed their lives. They had books that had children who looked like them in it, and we were attacked all over the place. But the bottom line was that Mississippi gave birth to the Children's Defense Fund in many ways, and it also occurred to me that children and preventive investment, and avoiding costly care and failure and neglect, was a more strategic way to proceed. And so the Children's Defense Fund was born out of the Poor People's Campaign. But it was pretty clear that whatever you called black independent or brown independent was going to have a shrinking constituency. And who can be mad at a two-month-old baby or at a two-year-old toddler? A lot of people can be. They don't want to feed them, neither, from what we've seen. But it was the right judgment to make. And so out of the privilege of serving as the Poor People's Campaign coordinator for policy for two years, and there were two of them, and it was not a failure, because the seeds of change get planted and have to have people who are scut workers and follow up. And I'm a good scut worker and a persistent person. And you know, as a result, I would say that all those people on food stamps today ought to thank those poor people in the mud in Resurrection City. But it takes a lot of follow-up, detailed work -- and never going away. PM: And you've been doing it for 45 years, and you've seen some amazing outcomes. What are you proudest of out of the Children's Defense Fund? MWE: Well, I think the children now have sort of become a mainstream issue. We have got lots of new laws. Millions of children are getting food. Millions of children are getting a head start. Millions of children are getting Head Start and have gotten a head start, and the Child Health Insurance Program, CHIP, Medicaid expansions for children. We've been trying to reform the child welfare system for decades. We finally got a big breakthrough this year, and it says, be ready with the proposals when somebody's ready to move, and sometimes it takes five years, 10 years, 20 years, but you're there. I've been trying to keep children out of foster care and out of institutions and with their families, with preventive services. That got passed. But there are millions of children who have hope, who have access to early childhood. Now, we are not finished, and we are not going to ever feel finished until we end child poverty in the richest nation on earth. It's just ridiculous that we have to be demanding that. (Applause) PM: And there are so many of the problems in spite of the successes, and thank you for going through some of them, Marian -- the Freedom Schools, the generations of children now who have gone through Children's Defense Fund programs. But when you look around the world, in this country, the United States, and in other countries, there are still so many problems. What worries you the most? MWE: What worries me is how irresponsible we adults in power have been in passing on a healthier earth. And it worries me when I read the ""Bulletin of Atomic Scientists"" and see now that we are two minutes from midnight, and that's gotten closer. We have put our future and our children's future and safety at risk in a world that is still too much governed by violence. We must end that. We must stop investing in war and start investing in the young and in peace, and we are really so far away from doing that. (Applause) And I don't want my grandchildren to have to fight these battles all over again, and so I get more radical. The older I get, the more radical I get, because there are just some things that we as adults have to do for the next generations. And I looked at the sacrifices of Mrs. Hamer and all those people in Mississippi who risked their lives to give us a better life. But the United States has got to come to grips with its failure to invest in its children, and it's the Achilles' heel of this nation. How can you be one of the biggest economies in the world and you let 13.2 million children go live in poverty, and you let children go homeless when you've got the means to do it? We've got to rethink who we are as a people, be an example for the world. There should be no poverty. In fact, we want to say we're going to end poverty in the world. Just start at home. And we've made real progress, but it's such hard work, and it's going to be our Achilles' heel. We should stop giving more tax cuts, sorry folks, to billionaires rather than to babies and their health care. We should get our priorities straight. (Applause) That's not right, and it's not cost-effective. And the key to this country is going to be an educated child population, and yet we've got so many children who cannot read or write at the most basic levels. We're investing in the wrong things, and I wouldn't be upset about anybody having one billion, 10 billion [US dollars], if there were no hungry children, if there were no homeless children, if there were no uneducated children. And so it's really about what does it mean to live and lead this life. Why were we put on this earth? We were put on this earth to make things better for the next generations. And here we're worrying about climate change and global warming. And we're looking at, again, I constantly cite -- I look at that ""Bulletin of Atomic Scientists"" every year. And it says now: ""Two minutes to midnight."" Are we out of our minds, adults, about passing on a better a world to our children? That's what our purpose is, to leave a better world for everybody, and the concept of enough for everybody. There should be no hungry children in this world with the rich wealth that we have. And so I can't think of a bigger cause, and I think that I'm driven by my faith. And it's been a privilege to serve, but I always had the best role models in the world. Daddy always said God runs a full employment economy, and that if you just follow the need, you'll never lack for a purpose in life. And I watched the partnership -- because my mother was a true partner. I always knew I was as smart as my brothers, at least. And we always knew that we were not just to be about ourselves, but that we were here to serve. PM: Well, Marian, I want to say, on behalf of all the world's children, thank you for your passion, your purpose and your advocacy. (Applause)"
11:29,Tiana Epps-Johnson,What's needed to bring the US voting system into the 21st century,Jan 2019,"OK, I want to take a moment to let each of you think to yourselves about the last time you sent or received a fax. (Laughter) Well, for me, it was this morning, because one piece of my work is making sure that everyone in the US has the information that they need to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot. And collecting that information from the local government offices responsible for maintaining it means sending and receiving a lot of faxes. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights. It's one of the most tangible ways that each and every one of us can shape our communities. And as we enter this fourth industrial revolution, where technology is changing everything around us, you would think, with something as important as the right to vote, that we would have the most modern, secure, inclusive system that could exist ... But we don't. When we look at comparable democracies, the US has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the world. We have a system where even the most persistent voters come up against exhausting barriers. A system where 20th-century technology -- like fax machines -- and outdated practices stand in the way of full, vibrant participation. In US presidential elections, turnout hovers around 60 percent. The numbers are even lower for local elections. That means that nearly 40 percent of Americans aren't voters. That's nearly 100 million people. I believe in something very straightforward: that everyone should have the information that they need to become a voter, that the voting process should be seamless and secure and that every voter should have information they trust to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot. Because when more people vote, together, we make better decisions for our communities. So I've spent the last eight years on a mission to push our democracy into the 21st century. Now, one of the most common approaches to election modernization is advocating for policy change, and that's an incredibly important piece of the strategy for building a system where millions of more people become voters. But I've taken a different approach. I focused on a critical yet largely untapped resource for election modernization: local election officials. I work with thousands of local election officials across the country to build tools and skills that they can use immediately to transform the way that they're engaging today's voters. Folks like Kat and Marie. Kat and Marie have worked together for years in a windowless office in the basement of the Mercer County Courthouse in West Virginia. Together, they have a tremendous responsibility. They're local election officials serving Mercer County's 40,000 registered voters. Local election officials are the public servants that do the day-to-day work that makes our election system function. When you fill out a voter-registration form, they're the folks that process them and add you to the rolls. They're the folks who buy the technology that we use to cast and count ballots. They recruit and train the volunteers at your local polling place. And they're the official nonpartisan source for informing people in their communities about how to vote. And unlike other countries where there's some form of centralized election authority, in the US, there are 7,897 different county and municipal offices, like Kat and Marie's, that each have an independent role in administering elections. Yes, that's nearly 8,000 slightly different ways that you might experience voting based on where you happen to live. When I was talking with Kat and Marie, like so many election officials that I talk with in rural towns and in major cities alike, they were deeply proud of getting to help people in their communities, but they were also worried. All of the new tools that people were using to get information -- the internet, social media -- they were difficult to figure out how to use effectively. And they felt like they weren't fully meeting the needs of Mercer County voters. One thing that they really wished that they had was a website so they could create a hub with information about how to register in upcoming elections, and a place to put election results. See, at the time, when voters had questions, they had to either call or visit their office, which meant that Kat and Marie were inevitably answering the same questions over and over again, which is both a superinefficient use of their time, but also created totally unnecessary barriers for voters when that information could just live online. And Mercer County wasn't alone. At the time, they were one of 966 counties in the US that had no voting information online. I'll let that sink in. They were one of the nearly one-third of counties in the US that had no place online to find official information about how to vote. To Kat and Marie, not having and election website was unacceptable, but they didn't have very many options. They didn't have the budget to hire a web developer, they didn't have the expertise to build a site themselves, so they went without. And 40,000 voters in Mercer County went without. We're in a moment where we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform civic engagement. Technology is revolutionizing science and industry. It's already transformed how we connect with one another and understand the world around us, but our democratic institutions -- they're being left behind. The US is one of the few major democracies in the world that puts the onus of voter registration on the individual voter, rather than the government. The rules that govern how to vote vary from state to state, and sometimes even county to county. And we have ballots that are pages and pages long. This November, on my ballot, there are literally over 100 different people and referenda for me to make decisions about. We have to be using the best tools we can bring to bear to help voters navigate this complexity, and right now, we're not. One of the most common narratives I hear in my work is that people aren't civically engaged because they're apathetic -- because they don't care. But as my brilliant friends at the Center for Civic Design say, if there is apathy, it comes from the system, not the voter. We can change the system right now by connecting local election officials like Kat and Marie with 21st-century tools and the training that they need to use them to better serve voters. Tools and training to do things like use social media for voter engagement, or use data to staff and equip polling places so that we don't see hours-long lines at the polls, or training on cybersecurity best practices so that we can ensure that our voting systems are secure. When we invest in this approach, we see meaningful, lasting results. Kat and Marie are online now. Inspired by their experience, we built a website template using research-based best practices in civic design, and developed the training so that Kat and Marie are able to maintain their site themselves. In less than a week, they went from having never seen the back end of a website to building a resource for Mercer County voters that they have been independently keeping up to date since 2014. Today, the 40,000 voters in Mercer County and over 100,000 voters in counties across the country have everything that they need to become a voter directly from their local election official, on a mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, accessible website. And we can even further scale the impact when local election officials are not only reaching out through their own channels, but they're extending their reach by working in partnership with others. Efforts like the Ballot Information Project and the Voting Information Project work with election officials nationwide to create a centralized, standard database of key voting information, like what's on your ballot and where to vote. That information powers tools built by companies like Google and Facebook to get information in the places where people already are, like their newsfeed and search. In 2016, the Ballot Information Project connected the public with information about candidates and referenda over 200 millions times, helping between a third and a half of every single person who cast a ballot. And that model has been replicated for elections around the world. When we look at efforts in other areas of government, we can see the opportunity when we listen to the public's needs and we meet them with modern tools. I think about my friends at mRelief, who have helped 260,000 families unlock 42 million dollars in food benefits by helping government agencies transition away from a 20-page, paper-based application for food stamps to a process that can happen in 10 questions over text message in fewer than three minutes. That kind of transformation is possible in voting. It's happening right now, but there's still so much work to do. Now, if you have any technical bone in your body, I know what you're thinking. This is all solvable. The technology that we need exists. We collectively have the expertise. You might even be thinking about volunteering at your local election office. I love how solutions-oriented you are, but to be clear, the work that is needed to modernize our election system isn't something that's going to happen using 20 percent time, or through a hackathon, or by doing a one-off technology project. What we need is significant, sustained, long-term investment. Investment in technology and investment in the skills of local election officials to run 21st-century elections, because if we don't invest in the long game, we risk finding ourselves perpetually behind. So if you're ready to help millions, if you're ready to close the gap between the system that we have and the system that we deserve, we need you. Organizations that are doing this work year-round need you. Local election offices need you. Come join us. Thank you. (Applause)"
12:19,Ariana Curtis,"Museums should honor the everyday, not just the extraordinary",Dec 2018,"Representation matters. Authentic representations of women matter. I think that too often, our public representations of women are enveloped in the language of the extraordinary. The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire: Madam C. J. Walker ... The dresses of the first ladies of the United States ... Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek the US Democratic party's presidential nomination -- (Applause) As a museum curator, I understand why these stories are so seductive. Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational. But those stories are limiting. By definition, being extraordinary is nonrepresentative. It's atypical. Those stories do not create a broad base for incorporating women's history, and they don't reflect our daily realities. If we can collectively apply that radical notion that women are people, it becomes easier to show women as people are: familiar, diverse, present. In everyone's everyday throughout history, women exist positively -- not as a matter of interpretation, but as a matter of fact. And beyond a more accurate representation of human life, including women considers the quotidian experiences of the almost 3.8 billion people identified as female on this planet. In this now notorious museum scene from the ""Black Panther"" movie, a white curator erroneously explains an artifact to Michael B. Jordan's character seen here, an artifact from his own culture. This fictional scene caused real debates in our museum communities about who is shaping the narratives and the bias that those narratives hold. Museums are actually rated one of the most trustworthy sources of information in the United States, and with hundreds of millions of visitors from all over the world, we should tell accurate histories, but we don't. There is a movement from within museums themselves to help combat this bias. The simple acknowledgment that museums are not neutral. Museums are didactic. Through the display of art and artifacts, we can incite creativity and foster inclusion, but we are guilty of historical misrepresentation. Our male-centered histories have left our herstories hidden. And there are hard truths about being a woman, especially a woman of color in this industry, that prevents us from centering inclusive examples of women's lives. Museum leadership: predominantly white and male, despite women comprising some 60 percent of museum staffs. Pipelines to leadership for women are bleak -- bleakest for women of color. And the presence of women does not in and of itself guarantee an increase in women's public representation. Not all women are gender equity allies. In the words of feminist theorist bell hooks, ""Patriarchy has no gender."" Women can support the system of patriarchy just as men can support the fight for gender equity. And we often downplay the importance of intersectionality. Marian Anderson was one of the most celebrated voices of the 20th century, and the Smithsonian collected her 1939 outfit. After the white Daughters of the American Revolution denied her access to sing in Constitution Hall, because she was black, she famously sang instead on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, to a crowd of over 75,000 people. And in libraries all over, including museums, you can still find the groundbreaking 1982 anthology, entitled ""All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave."" Demands for the increase of women's representation does not automatically include Afro-Latinas like me ... or immigrant women, or Asian women, or Native women, or trans women, or undocumented women, or women over 65, or girls -- the list can go on and on and on. So what do we do? Targeted initiatives have helped incorporate perspectives that should have always been included. I arrived at the Smithsonian through a Latino curatorial initiative whose hiring of Latinx curators, mostly women, by the way, has raised the profile for Latinx narratives across our institution. And it served as a model for our much larger Smithsonian American Women's History Initiative, which seeks to amplify diverse representations of women in every possible way, so that women show up, not only in the imagery of our contemporary realities, but in our historical representations, because we've always been here. Right now though, in 2018, I can still walk into professional spaces and be the only -- the only person under 40, the only black person, the only black woman, the only Latina, sometimes, the only woman. My mother is African-American and my father is Afro-Panamanian. I am so proudly and inextricably both. As an Afro-Latina, I'm one of millions. As an Afro-Latina curator, I'm one of very few. And bringing my whole self into the professional realm can feel like an act of bravery, and I'll admit to you that I was not always up for that challenge, whether from fear of rejection or self-preservation. In meetings, I would only speak up when I had a fully developed comment to share. No audible brainstorming or riffing off of colleagues. For a long time, I denied myself the joy of wearing my beloved hoop earrings or nameplate necklace to work, thinking that they were too loud or unscholarly or unprofessional. (Laughter) I wondered how people would react to my natural hair, or if they viewed me as more acceptable or less authentic when I straightened it. And anyone who has felt outside of mainstream representations understands that there are basic elements just of our everyday being that can make other people uncomfortable. But because I am passionate about the everyday representation of women as we are, I stopped presenting an inauthentic representation of myself or my work. And I have been tested. This is me pointing at my hoop earring in my office -- (Laughter) Just last month, I was invited to keynote a Latino Heritage Month event. The week of the presentation, the organization expressed concerns. They called my slides ""activist,"" and they meant that negatively. (Laughter) (Applause) Two days before the presentation, they requested that I not show a two-minute video affirming natural hair, because ""it may create a barrier to the learning process for some of the participants."" (Laughter) That poem, ""Hair,"" was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated. I canceled the talk, explaining to them that their censorship of me and my work made me uncomfortable. (Applause and cheers) Respectability politics and idealized femininity influence how we display women and which women we choose to display. And that display has skewed toward successful and extraordinary and reputable and desirable, which maintains the systemic exclusion and marginalization of the everyday, the regular, the underrepresented and usually, the nonwhite. As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative. I research, collect and interpret objects and images of significance. Celia Cruz, the queen of Salsa -- (Cheers) yes -- is significant. And an Afro-Latina. The Smithsonian has collected her costumes, her shoes, her portrait, her postage stamp and this reimagining ... by artist Tony Peralta. When I collected and displayed this work, it was a victory for symbolic contradictions. Pride in displaying a dark-skinned Latina, a black woman, whose hair is in large rollers which straighten your hair, perhaps a nod to white beauty standards. A refined, glamorous woman in oversized, chunky gold jewelry. When this work was on view, it was one of our most Instagrammed pieces, and visitors told me they connected with the everyday elements of her brown skin or her rollers or her jewelry. Our collections include Celia Cruz and a rare portrait of a young Harriet Tubman ... iconic clothing from the incomparable Oprah Winfrey. But museums can literally change how hundreds of millions of people see women and which women they see. So rather than always the first or the famous, it's also our responsibility to show a regular Saturday at the beauty salon, the art of door-knocker earrings ... (Laughter) fashionable sisterhood ... (Laughter) and cultural pride at all ages. Stories of everyday women whose stories have been knowingly omitted from our national and global histories. And oftentimes in museums, you see women represented by clothing or portraits or photography ... but impactful, life-changing stories from everyday women can also look like this Esmeraldan boat seat. Esmeraldas, Ecuador was a maroon community. Its dense rainforest protected indigenous and African populations from Spanish colonizers. There are roads now, but there are some parts inland that are still only accessible by canoe. Débora Nazareno frequently traveled those Ecuadorian waterways by canoe, so she had her own boat seat. Hers personalized with a spiderweb and a spider, representing Anansi, a character in West African folklore. Débora also sat on this seat at home, telling stories to her grandson, Juan. And this intangible ritual of love in the form of intergenerational storytelling is common in communities across the African diaspora. And this everyday act sparked in Juan the desire to collect and preserve over 50,000 documents related to Afro-Indian culture. In 2005, Juan García Salazar, Débora's grandson, and by now a world-renowned Afro-Ecuadorian scholar, traveled to Washington, D.C. He met with Lonnie Bunch, the director of the museum where I work, and toward the end of their conversation, Juan reached into his bag and said, ""I'd like to give you a present."" On that day, Débora Nazareno's humble wooden boat seat became the very first object donated to the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. It is encased, displayed and has been seen by almost five million visitors from all over the world. I will continue to collect from extraordinary historymakers. Their stories are important. But what drives me to show up today and every day is the simple passion to write our names in history, display them publicly for millions to see and walk in the ever-present light that is woman. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"
14:53,Neylan McBaine,Lessons from Utah's legacy of women's suffrage,Dec 2018,
12:38,Stacey Abrams,3 questions to ask yourself about everything you do,Dec 2018,"When I was in high school at the age of 17 -- I graduated from high school in Decatur, Georgia, as valedictorian of my high school -- I was very proud of myself. I was from a low-income community, I had grown up in Mississippi, we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia so my parents could pursue their degrees as United Methodist ministers. We were poor, but they didn't think we were poor enough, so they were going for permanent poverty. (Laughter) And so, while they studied at Emory, I studied at Avondale, and I became valedictorian. Well, one of the joys of being valedictorian in the state of Georgia is that you get invited to meet the governor of Georgia. I was mildly interested in meeting him. It was kind of cool. I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion, because I watched a lot of ""General Hospital"" and ""Dynasty"" as a child. (Laughter) And so I got up that morning, ready to go to visit the governor. My mom and my dad, who were also invited, got up, and we went outside. But we didn't get in our car. And in the South, a car is a necessary thing. We don't have a lot of public transit, there aren't a lot of options. But if you're lucky enough to live in a community where you don't have a car, the only option is public transit. And that's what we had to take. And so we got on the bus. And we took the bus from Decatur all the way to Buckhead, where the Governor's Mansion sat on this really beautiful acreage of land, with these long black gates that ran the length of the property. We get to the Governor's Mansion, we pull the little lever that lets them know this is our stop, we get off the bus, my mom, my dad and I, we walk across the street. We walk up the driveway, because there are cars coming up, cars bringing in students from all across the state of Georgia. So we're walking along the side. And as we walk single file along the side, my mom and dad sandwiching me to make sure I don't get hit by one of the cars bringing in the other valedictorians, we approach the guard gate. When we get to the guard gate, the guard comes out. He looks at me, and he looks at my parents, and he says, ""You don't belong here, this is a private event."" My dad says, ""No, this is my daughter, Stacey. She's one of the valedictorians."" But the guard doesn't look at the checklist that's in his hands. He doesn't ask my mom for the invitation that's at the bottom of her very voluminous purse. Instead, he looks over our shoulder at the bus, because in his mind, the bus is telling him a story about who should be there. And the fact that we were too poor to have our own car -- that was a story he told himself. And he may have seen something in my skin color, he may have seen something in my attire; I don't know what went through his mind. But his conclusion was to look at me again, and with a look of disdain, say, ""I told you, this is a private event. You don't belong here."" Now, my parents were studying to become United Methodist ministers, but they were not pastors yet. (Laughter) And so they proceeded to engage this gentleman in a very robust discussion of his decision-making skills. (Laughter) My father may have mentioned that he was going to spend eternity in a very fiery place if he didn't find my name on that checklist. And indeed, the man checks the checklist eventually, and he found my name, and he let us inside. But I don't remember meeting the governor of Georgia. I don't recall meeting my fellow valedictorians from 180 school districts. The only clear memory I have of that day was a man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia, looking at me and telling me I don't belong. And so I decided, 20-some-odd years later, to be the person who got to open the gates. (Cheers) (Applause) Unfortunately, you may have read the rest of the story. It didn't quite work out that way. And now I'm tasked with figuring out: How do I move forward? Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated and told they don't belong. I wanted to open those gates for Latinas and for Asian Americans. I wanted to open those gates for the undocumented and the documented. I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community. I wanted to open those gates for the families that have to call themselves the victims of gun violence. I wanted to open those gates wide for everyone in Georgia, because that is our state, and this is our nation, and we all belong here. (Cheers) (Applause) But what I recognized is that the first try wasn't enough. And my question became: How do I move forward? How do I get beyond the bitterness and the sadness and the lethargy and watching an inordinate amount of television as I eat ice cream? (Laughter) What do I do next? And I'm going to do what I've always done. I'm going to move forward, because going backwards isn't an option and standing still is not enough. (Applause) You see, I began my race for governor by analyzing who I was and what I wanted to be. And there are three questions I ask myself about everything I do, whether it's running for office or starting a business; when I decided to start the New Georgia Project to register people to vote; or when I started the latest action, Fair Fight Georgia. No matter what I do, I ask myself three questions: What do I want? Why do I want it? And how do I get it? And in this case, I know what I want. I want change. That is what I want. But the question is: What change do I want to see? And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are: One, am I honest about the scope of my ambition? Because it's easy to figure out that once you didn't get what you wanted, then maybe you should have set your sights a little lower, but I'm here to tell you to be aggressive about your ambition. Do not allow setbacks to set you back. (Applause) Number two, let yourself understand your mistakes. But also understand their mistakes, because, as women in particular, we're taught that if something doesn't work out, it's probably our fault. And usually, there is something we could do better, but we've been told not to investigate too much what the other side could have done. And this isn't partisan -- it's people. We're too often told that our mistakes are ours alone, but victory is a shared benefit. And so what I tell you to do is understand your mistakes, but understand the mistakes of others. And be clearheaded about it. And be honest with yourself and honest with those who support you. But once you know what you want, understand why you want it. And even though it feels good, revenge is not a good reason. (Laughter) Instead, make sure you want it because there's something not that you should do, but something you must do. It has to be something that doesn't allow you to sleep at night unless you're dreaming about it; something that wakes you up in the morning and gets you excited about it; or something that makes you so angry, you know you have to do something about it. But know why you're doing it. And know why it must be done. You've listened to women from across this world talk about why things have to happen. But figure out what the ""why"" is for you, because jumping from the ""what"" to the ""do"" is meaningless if you don't know why. Because when it gets hard, when it gets tough, when your friends walk away from you, when your supporters forget you, when you don't win your first race -- if you don't know why, you can't try again. So, first know what you want. Second, know why you want it, but third, know how you're going to get it done. I faced a few obstacles in this race. (Laughter) Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party. (Cheers) (Applause) But more importantly, in this process, we turned out 1.2 million African American voters in Georgia. That is more voters than voted on the Democratic side of the ticket in 2014. (Applause) Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia. We tripled the number of Asian Americans who stood up and said, ""This is our state, too."" Those are successes that tell me how I can get it done. But they also let me understand the obstacles aren't insurmountable. They're just a little high. But I also understand that there are three things that always hold us hostage. The first is finances. Now, you may have heard, I'm in a little bit of debt. If you didn't hear about it, you did not go outside. (Laughter) And finances are something that holds us back so often, our dreams are bounded by how much we have in resources. But we hear again and again the stories of those who overcome those resource challenges. But you can't overcome something you don't talk about. And that's why I didn't allow them to debt-shame me in my campaign. I didn't allow anyone to tell me that my lack of opportunity was a reason to disqualify me from running. And believe me, people tried to tell me I shouldn't run. Friends told me not to run. Allies told me not to run. ""USA Today"" mentioned maybe I shouldn't run. (Laughter) But no matter who it was, I understood that finances are often a reason we don't let ourselves dream. I can't say that you will always overcome those obstacles, but I will tell you, you will be damned if you do not try. (Applause) The second is fear. And fear is real. It is paralyzing. It is terrifying. But it can also be energizing, because once you know what you're afraid of, you can figure out how to get around it. And the third is fatigue. Sometimes you just get tired of trying. You get tired of reading about processes and politics and the things that stop you from getting where you want to be. Sometimes, fatigue means that we accept position instead of power. We let someone give us a title as a consolation prize, rather than realizing we know what we want and we're going to get it, even if we're tired. That's why God created naps. (Laughter) But we also learn in those moments that fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much we want it. Because if you are beaten down, if you have worked as hard as you can, if you have done everything you said you should, and it still doesn't work out, fatigue can sap you of your energy. But that's why you go back to the ""why"" of it. Because I know we have to have women who speak for the voiceless. I know we have to have people of good conscience who stand up against oppression. I know we have to have people who understand that social justice belongs to us all. And that wakes me up every morning, and that makes me fight even harder. Because I am moving forward, knowing what is in my past. I know the obstacles they have for me. I know what they're going to do, and I'm fairly certain they're energizing and creating new obstacles now. But they've got four years to figure it out. (Laughter) (Applause) Maybe two. (Cheers) (Applause) But here's my point: I know what I want, and that is justice. I know why I want it, because poverty is immoral, and it is a stain on our nation. And I know how I'm going to get it: by moving forward every single day. Thank you so much. (Cheers) (Applause)"
9:04,Monica Palacio,Why the District of Columbia should get an equal right to vote,Nov 2018,
18:43,Graham Allison,Is war between China and the US inevitable?,Oct 2018,"So, let me thank you for the opportunity to talk about the biggest international story of your professional lifetime, which is also the most important international challenge the world will face for as far as the eye can see. The story, of course, is the rise of China. Never before have so many people risen so far so fast, on so many different dimensions. The challenge is the impact of China's rise -- the discombobulation this will cause the Unites States and the international order, of which the US has been the principal architect and guardian. The past 100 years have been what historians now call an ""American Century."" Americans have become accustomed to their place at the top of every pecking order. So the very idea of another country that could be as big and strong as the US -- or bigger -- strikes many Americans as an assault on who they are. For perspective on what we're now seeing in this rivalry, it's useful to locate it on the larger map of history. The past 500 years have seen 16 cases in which a rising power threatened to displace a ruling power. Twelve of those ended in war. So just in November, we'll all pause to mark the 100th anniversary of the final day of a war that became so encompassing, that it required historians to create an entirely new category: world war. So, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the guns of World War I fell silent, but 20 million individuals lay dead. I know that this is a sophisticated audience, so you know about the rise of China. I'm going to focus, therefore, on the impact of China's rise, on the US, on the international order and on the prospects for war and peace. But having taught at Harvard over many years, I've learned that from time to time, it's useful to take a short pause, just to make sure we're all on the same page. The way I do this is, I call a time-out, I give students a pop quiz -- ungraded, of course. So, let's try this. Time-out, pop quiz. Question: forty years ago, 1978, China sets out on its march to the market. At that point, what percentage of China's one billion citizens were struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day? Take a guess -- 25 percent? Fifty? Seventy-five? Ninety. What do you think? Ninety. Nine out of every 10 on less than two dollars a day. Twenty eighteen, 40 years later. What about the numbers? What's your bet? Take a look. Fewer than one in 100 today. And China's president has promised that within the next three years, those last tens of millions will have been raised up above that threshold. So it's a miracle, actually, in our lifetime. Hard to believe. But brute facts are even harder to ignore. A nation that didn't even appear on any of the international league tables 25 years ago has soared, to rival -- and in some areas, surpass -- the United States. Thus, the challenge that will shape our world: a seemingly unstoppable rising China accelerating towards an apparently immovable ruling US, on course for what could be the grandest collision in history. To help us get our minds around this challenge, I'm going to introduce you to a great thinker, I'm going to present a big idea, and I'm going to pose a most consequential question. The great thinker is Thucydides. Now, I know his name is a mouthful, and some people have trouble pronouncing it. So, let's do it, one, two, three, together: Thucydides. One more time: Thucydides. So who was Thucydides? He was the father and founder of history. He wrote the first-ever history book. It's titled ""The History of the Peloponnesian War,"" about the war in Greece, 2500 years ago. So if nothing else today, you can tweet your friends, ""I met a great thinker. And I can even pronounce his name: Thucydides."" So, about this war that destroyed classical Greece, Thucydides wrote famously: ""It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made the war inevitable."" So the rise of one and the reaction of the other create a toxic cocktail of pride, arrogance, paranoia, that drug them both to war. Which brings me to the big idea: Thucydides's Trap. ""Thucydides's Trap"" is a term I coined several years ago, to make vivid Thucydides's insight. Thucydides's Trap is the dangerous dynamic that occurs when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power, like Athens -- or Germany 100 years ago, or China today -- and their impact on Sparta, or Great Britain 100 years ago, or the US today. As Henry Kissinger has said, once you get this idea, this concept of Thucydides's Trap in your head, it will provide a lens for helping you look through the news and noise of the day to understand what's actually going on. So, to the most consequential question about our world today: Are we going to follow in the footsteps of history? Or can we, through a combination of imagination and common sense and courage find a way to manage this rivalry without a war nobody wants, and everybody knows would be catastrophic? Give me five minutes to unpack this, and later this afternoon, when the next news story pops up for you about China doing this, or the US reacting like that, you will be able to have a better understanding of what's going on and even to explain it to your friends. So as we saw with this flipping the pyramid of poverty, China has actually soared. It's meteoric. Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel, I think, put it best. He said, ""All this has happened so fast, we haven't yet had time to be astonished."" (Laughter) To remind myself how astonished I should be, I occasionally look out the window in my office in Cambridge at this bridge, which goes across the Charles River, between the Kennedy School and Harvard Business School. In 2012, the State of Massachusetts said they were going to renovate this bridge, and it would take two years. In 2014, they said it wasn't finished. In 2015, they said it would take one more year. In 2016, they said it's not finished, we're not going to tell you when it's going to be finished. Finally, last year, it was finished -- three times over budget. Now, compare this to a similar bridge that I drove across last month in Beijing. It's called the Sanyuan Bridge. In 2015, the Chinese decided they wanted to renovate that bridge. It actually has twice as many lanes of traffic. How long did it take for them to complete the project? Twenty fifteen, what do you bet? Take a guess -- OK, three -- Take a look. (Laughter) The answer is 43 hours. (Audience: Wow!) (Laughter) Graham Allison: Now, of course, that couldn't happen in New York. (Laughter) Behind this speed in execution is a purpose-driven leader and a government that works. The most ambitious and most competent leader on the international stage today is Chinese President Xi Jinping. And he's made no secret about what he wants. As he said when he became president six years ago, his goal is to make China great again -- (Laughter) a banner he raised long before Donald Trump picked up a version of this. To that end, Xi Jinping has announced specific targets for specific dates: 2025, 2035, 2049. By 2025, China means to be the dominant power in the major market in 10 leading technologies, including driverless cars, robots, artificial intelligence, quantum computing. By 2035, China means to be the innovation leader across all the advanced technologies. And by 2049, which is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, China means to be unambiguously number one, including, [says] Xi Jinping, an army that he calls ""Fight and Win."" So these are audacious goals, but as you can see, China is already well on its way to these objectives. And we should remember how fast our world is changing. Thirty years ago, the World Wide Web had not yet even been invented. Who will feel the impact of this rise of China most directly? Obviously, the current number one. As China gets bigger and stronger and richer, technologically more advanced, it will inevitably bump up against American positions and prerogatives. Now, for red-blooded Americans -- and especially for red-necked Americans like me; I'm from North Carolina -- there's something wrong with this picture. The USA means number one, that's who we are. But again, to repeat: brute facts are hard to ignore. Four years ago, Senator John McCain asked me to testify about this to his Senate Armed Services Committee. And I made for them a chart that you can see, that said, compare the US and China to kids on opposite ends of a seesaw on a playground, each represented by the size of their economy. As late as 2004, China was just half our size. By 2014, its GDP was equal to ours. And on the current trajectory, by 2024, it will be half again larger. The consequences of this tectonic change will be felt everywhere. For example, in the current trade conflict, China is already the number one trading partner of all the major Asian countries. Which brings us back to our Greek historian. Harvard's ""Thucydides's Trap Case File"" has reviewed the last 500 years of history and found 16 cases in which a rising power threatened to displace a ruling power. Twelve of these ended in war. And the tragedy of this is that in very few of these did either of the protagonists want a war; few of these wars were initiated by either the rising power or the ruling power. So how does this work? What happens is, a third party's provocation forces one or the other to react, and that sets in motion a spiral, which drags the two somewhere they don't want to go. If that seems crazy, it is. But it's life. Remember World War I. The provocation in that case was the assassination of a second-level figure, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which then led the Austro-Hungarian emperor to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, they dragged in the various allies, within two months, all of Europe was at war. So imagine if Thucydides were watching planet Earth today. What would he say? Could he find a more appropriate leading man for the ruling power than Donald J Trump? (Laughter) Or a more apt lead for the rising power than Xi Jinping? And he would scratch his head and certainly say he couldn't think of more colorful provocateur than North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Each seems determined to play his assigned part and is right on script. So finally, we conclude again with the most consequential question, the question that will have the gravest consequences for the rest of our lives: Are Americans and Chinese going to let the forces of history drive us to a war that would be catastrophic for both? Or can we summon the imagination and courage to find a way to survive together, to share the leadership in the 21st century, or, as Xi Jinping [said], to create a new form of great power relations? That's the issue I've been pursuing passionately for the last two years. I've had the opportunity to talk and, indeed, to listen to leaders of all the relevant governments -- Beijing, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo -- and to thought leaders across the spectrum of both the arts and business. I wish I had more to report. The good news is that leaders are increasingly aware of this Thucydidean dynamic and the dangers that it poses. The bad news is that nobody has a feasible plan for escaping history as usual. So it's clear to me that we need some ideas outside the box of conventional statecraft -- indeed, from another page or another space -- which is what brings me to TED today and which brings me to a request. This audience includes many of the most creative minds on the planet, who get up in the morning and think not only about how to manage the world we have, but how to create worlds that should be. So I'm hopeful that as this sinks in and as you reflect on it, some of you are going to have some bold ideas, actually some wild ideas, that when we find, will make a difference in this space. And just to remind you if you do, this won't be the first time. Let me remind you of what happened right after World War II. A remarkable group of Americans and Europeans and others, not just from government, but from the world of culture and business, engaged in a collective surge of imagination. And what they imagined and what they created was a new international order, the order that's allowed you and me to live our lives, all of our lives, without great power war and with more prosperity than was ever seen before on the planet. So, a remarkable story. Interestingly, every pillar of this project that produced these results, when first proposed, was rejected by the foreign policy establishment as naive or unrealistic. My favorite is the Marshall Plan. After World War II, Americans felt exhausted. They had demobilized 10 million troops, they were focused on an urgent domestic agenda. But as people began to appreciate how devastated Europe was and how aggressive Soviet communism was, Americans eventually decided to tax themselves a percent and a half of GDP every year for four years and send that money to Europe to help reconstruct these countries, including Germany and Italy, whose troops had just been killing Americans. Amazing. This also created the United Nations. Amazing. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The World Bank. NATO. All of these elements of an order for peace and prosperity. So, in a word, what we need to do is do it again. And I think now we need a surge of imagination, creativity, informed by history, for, as the philosopher Santayana reminded us, in the end, only those who refuse to study history are condemned to repeat it. Thank you. (Applause)"
17:11,Joan C. Williams,We won't fix US politics until we talk about class,Oct 2018,"Let's start here: raise your hand if you consider yourself middle class. (Chuckles) That's a lot of people. Now, I'm guessing that some of you who raised your hands live in households that earn $200,000 or more a year. That's actually not middle class; that's the top six percent. But, you know, as Americans, we use the term ""middle class"" almost indiscriminately. So in a recent Bloomberg story, an amusement park worker earning $22,000 a year and a lawyer earning $200,000 both described themselves as middle class. What happens if we look at Americans who are just actually in the middle? Here's what we see. The bottom 30 percent of Americans are poor. Their median household income is around $22,000. Then the middle 53 percent have a median household income of around $75,000. Typically, they have blue- and pink-collar jobs. And then the top 17 percent are the professional managerial elite, or PME. They have a median household income of about $173,000. So, as Americans, we're a little clueless about class. Why does it even matter? Well, we've heard a lot about the top one percent and the bottom 99, but the conflict that's driving American politics today is between the PME - that top 17 percent - and Americans in the middle. So we need to learn more about that. Here's where it started. The PME lost connection with a group whom prior generations had given a place of honor. So this is actually right here in Denver. It's the Mountain States Telephone Company headquarters over on 14th Street, and it's a mural painted in 1929. Look at how it celebrates the nobility of blue-collar work. Similar things all over the country. But that was on the wane by around 1970, when the famous show ""All in the Family"" featured Archie Bunker, a blue-collar guy who was depicted as racist, sexist, stupid, and fat. And then in the 1990s came Homer Simpson: (Laughter) amiable but ignorant. Also fat. (Laughter) Closer to our day, in ""Orange is the New Black,"" the character of Pennsatucky is a white working-class woman. She's depicted as coarse, ugly, ignorant. Check out the teeth. Class consciousness has given way to class callousness. And at exactly the same period when you had this shift from celebration to shame, the economic future of the American middle class just tanked. So, for example, virtually all Americans who were born in the 1940s did better than their parents. But today it's about half. And wages used to rise when productivity rose, until the '70s. That stopped. If it had continued, wages would be about double what they are today. And so blue-collar America heard the cultural disrespect, and they deeply mourn the passing of the American Dream. The result is a politics ruled by fury. ""We voted with our middle finger,"" (Laughter) said one Trump South Carolina voter. (Laughter) Said another voter, ""My fellow liberals should have listened to those of us they call hicks, hillbillies, toothless idiots. They should have understood that we don't live in a flyover state; we live in our home."" You know, I don't like what this dynamic is doing to American politics for two reasons: The first is ethical. I'm committed to social equality for all groups, not just for some groups. And the second is strategic. The hidden injuries of class are fueling a politics so polarized that our democracy is threatened. Now, in order to begin to turn this around, we have to understand more about what I call the ""class culture gap."" Because class isn't just about money; it's also a set of cultural traditions that we riff off of to shape our everyday behavior and make sense of our lives. Class affects everything we do - from that first cup of coffee we have in the morning to whether we prefer the edgy or the tried and true. Let's first look at the professional managerial elite. Their central ethic is self-development. That's why as parents we spend so much time trying to discover our children's every little micro-talent and develop it posthaste. These jobs require independent thinking, and so we focus on individual achievement and work devotion. And we display our originality. Everything is artisanal, from ice cream to spiritualities, and edgy because being disruptive can yield a unicorn - a Silicon Valley company with a billion-dollar valuation. But, you know, in blue- and pink-collar jobs, being disruptive just gets you one thing, and that's fired. Whereas the PME kind of takes stability for granted, in blue-collar America, stability is hard-won, and it's much cherished. And so the focus is on self-discipline - the kind that gets you to work every day, on time, without an attitude, to an often not very fulfilling job. This is why the middle class so deeply, deeply values institutions that aid self-discipline - the military, traditional religion, traditional family life - and why the taste is for the tried and true. Think ample portions of comfort food - Olive Garden - rather than smidgens of sophistication - think ""tasting menu."" (Laughter) So, what does all this have to do with politics? It turns out it has a lot. Let's examine that by looking at two of the most divisive issues in the United States today: guns and abortion. Let's start first with abortion and with me. My grandmother was one of the first women ever admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School. She eloped with her handsome rabbi, my grandfather, just a few weeks or months before completing her degree. Again and again, she tried to get readmitted. No go. Finally, the family moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where a former classmate was by then dean of the Yale Medical School. So she went, and she basically begged. He said, ""Irma, you should be ashamed of yourself. You already have a job: a husband and children."" And so she gave up. My mother gave up about 20 years later when she was fired from the only job she ever truly loved as a reporter with the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, when the men came back from World War II. And so, coming up, I carried two generations of pain. And I wanted to make sure that pain didn't define my life too. That's why abortion rights have always seemed so important to me. I knew I needed to graduate from college and then from law school and then I needed to get tenure. An ill-timed pregnancy - it could jeopardize everything. And that's why two-thirds of college grads in the United States support abortion rights, but only about half of those with high school or less do. The logic of their lives is often different. They fault the PME for unhealthy work worship and a failure to understand that family comes first. And their daily lives also look really different. The demise of blue-collar jobs means that these families face a daily scramble, with mom working one shift and dad working a different shift, sometimes literally handing over the baby in the parking lot in between. And these tag-team families, they're under such stress that they have three to six times the national divorce rate. And so they look back on the breadwinner-homemaker family with nostalgia, and they still hold it up as an ideal. You know, these fights over abortion, they're fights over what it means to be a good woman. Identities are at risk, which is why they get so ugly so fast. Because when you have one side calling the other ""mindless misogynists,"" to be met with a response ""you're selfish careerists,"" class conflict becomes acute. You know, debates over guns are similarly visceral. To me, the ready availability of guns - it means Las Vegas, Sandy Hook. It means boys murdering their classmates. It means men killing people in church. But even as I feel so strongly about guns, I understand how people feel differently. Because if abortion involves ideals of womanhood, guns involve ideals of manhood. And that's why two-thirds of women but only 43 percent of men support stricter gun laws. And there's also a strong class dynamic. So 57 percent of Americans with postgraduate education but only about 35 percent of Americans who have high school or less feel that gun ownership endangers safety. ""Where I come from,"" said Democrat John Edwards of North Carolina - he said, ""You know, guns, they're not just about guns. They're also about independence."" And that independence intertwines with masculinity. Protecting one's family is key to the identities of blue- but not white-collar men. And in large areas of the country, hunting is a key form of male bonding and male solidarity. And Jennifer Sherman's study of rural California found many men on disability due to lack of jobs who hunted to help support their families. These rural men were using guns to claim a full measure of masculine dignity: protecting, providing, pleasure, power - all key ingredients of the masculine role. And look, I wish masculinity worked differently, but whether you're poor or privileged, being a man is often seen as something that has to be earned over and over and over again. After all, pleasure, power, providing - they pervade Hollywood and Silicon Valley too, where work's a masculinity contest and harassing women's just one way of keeping score. So where does this leave us? Here's where it is really, really easy to see someone else's truths as partial and parochial. What's hard is to see your own truths that way too. We all spend so much time trying to convince the other side that we're right and they're wrong - if only they would listen to us. But here's the reality: our politics stem from our values, and our values reflect our lives - lives deeply shaped by social class. The PME feels entitled to self-development, whereas the middle class seeks stability through self-discipline. So what seems so obvious to one group may not seem obvious to the other - obvious or even true. How can we begin to compromise on these issues that go straight to the center of our identities? Three steps can help: The first is we need to lower the level of ambient anger by lowering the level of open insult. Class slurs should be as stigmatized as racial slurs. (Applause) The second step is that we need to address the key engine of middle-class fury. The PME needs to care about the economic prospects of the two-thirds of Americans who lack college degrees. (Applause) You know, these proxy wars on guns and religion, they reflect the raw pain of Americans unable to give their families a future. And the last is the most important. We all, on both sides, need to change the way we think about each other. You know, too often, advocates on both sides, they're absolutists, convinced of their own moral purity. But I think we're better off if we leave politics and purity separate. Politics is about the messy business of living peaceably with decent people whose lives give them a different truth lens. The sooner we begin to bridge this class culture gap, the sooner American politics will step back from the brink. Let's start now. Thank you. (Applause)"
12:56,Rebecca Onie,What Americans agree on when it comes to health,Oct 2018,"Today, we are a country divided, or at least that's what we're told. We are torn apart by immigration, education, guns and health care. Health care is ugly and it is loud, so loud that it threatens to drown out everything else. (Voice-over) Protesters: Health care is a human right! Fight, fight, fight! Protesters: Hey hey! Ho ho! Obamacare has got to go! Rebecca Onie: But what if underneath all the noise, we're not divided? What if the things that we don't ask about are the things that we most agree upon? It turns out that when we ask the right questions, the answers are startling, because we agree, not on health care, but on something more important: we agree on health. For 20 years, I've been obsessed with one question: What do we, what do all of us need in order to be healthy? As a college student in 1995, I spent months talking to physicians at a chaotic hospital in Boston, asking them, ""What's the one thing your patients most need to be healthy?"" They shared the same story again and again, one that I've heard hundreds of variations of since. They say, ""Every day I see a patient with an asthma exacerbation, and I prescribe a controller medication. But I know she is living in a mold-infested apartment. Or I see a kid with an ear infection, and I prescribe antibiotics, but I know there is no food at home. And I don't ask about those issues, because there's nothing I can do."" Now, it seemed that it shouldn't be so complicated to design a doctor's visit around what people actually need to be healthy. So I created Health Leads, an organization enabling thousands of physicians and other caregivers to ask their patients, ""What do you need to be healthy?"" and then prescribe those things -- fruits and vegetables, heat in the winter, electricity to refrigerate their medication -- and we then navigated patients to those resources in their communities. The model works. A Mass General Hospital study found that navigating patients to essential resources is associated with improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels similar to introducing a new drug, but without all the side effects. So two decades later, what's changed? It's now widely recognized that just 20 percent of health outcomes are tied to medical care, whereas up to 70 percent are tied to healthy behaviors and what's called the social determinants of health -- basically, everything that happens to us for that vast majority of time when we're not in the doctor's office or the hospital. Health care executives now routinely remind us that our zip code matters more than our genetic code. And one health care publication even recently had the audacity to describe the social determinants of health as ""the feel-good buzzword of the year."" Now, there's been some action, too. Over the past decade, six major health care providers and insurers have committed over 600 million dollars to affordable housing, recognizing that it reduces infant mortality and increases life expectancy. But let's be honest. Is our 3.5 trillion dollar health care system fundamentally designed to create health? Absolutely not. Take access to healthy food. Not long ago, a teenage boy shows up at a hospital in Baltimore, losing weight. Just as his doctors are huddled up figuring out which metabolic panels and blood tests to run, one of my colleagues asks out loud, ""Do you think he might be hungry?"" It turned out that this kid had been kicked out of his housing and literally hadn't had a meal in weeks. He said he was ""... so relieved that somebody finally asked me."" Somehow, we've created a health care system where asking a patient ""Are you hungry?"" is so far outside the bounds of what counts as health care that we mostly fail or forget to ask altogether; where doctors lament a hospital's ""no third sandwich policy,"" meaning that if you're a hungry patient in the ER, you can have only two free sandwiches, but as many MRIs as the doctor orders; where, in 2016 in the state of Texas, they spent 1.2 billion dollars on the medical costs of malnutrition instead of on access to healthy food; where a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services program stratifies hungry patients, so that some get access to food and some get information about food, with the justification that doing nothing for hungry patients is standard and usual care in this country. And that's just food. The same is true for housing, electricity ... The bottom line is, health care may be changing, but not by enough and certainly not fast enough. We ask the wrong questions of our doctors, of our patients, but also of our citizens. We ask about and argue about health care, but how do voters think about health? No one could tell us the answer to that question, so we launched a new initiative and hired a polling firm to ask voters across the country: What do you need to be healthy? What was so striking about this was that no one has any clue what we are talking about in health care. Voters do not think the social determinants of health is a feel-good phrase. They actually hate it. ""What uneducated person came up with that language?"" one of the voters said. Or my favorite was the guy who said, ""You're killing me."" But when you strip away all the ridiculousness of our language in health care, we know exactly what creates health. So take Charlotte, North Carolina. We had two focus groups, one of African American Democratic women and one of white Republican women. And we asked them, ""If you had a hundred dollars, how would you spend it to buy health in your community? Turns out, they agree nearly to the last percentage point. First, they agree that health care only sort of impacts health. So they choose to spend the majority of their dollars outside of hospitals and clinics. And second, they agree on what creates health, spending 19 percent on affordable housing and about 25 percent on access to healthy food. So I am sure you are thinking, ""This has got to be a fluke."" But it's not. White and Latino male swing voters in Seattle, white and African American Democratic voters in Cleveland, white male Republicans in Dallas, low-income white Democrats in Hendersonville, North Carolina: their answers are strikingly similar, with all of them choosing to spend more money on healthy food and safe housing than they would on hospitals and health centers. When you ask the right questions, it becomes pretty clear: we may be fractured on health care in this country, but we are unified on health. The thing that I've been struggling with is why. Why do we agree on health? We agree on health because it is common sense. We all know that the things we need to get healthy -- medicine and medical care -- are not the things we need to be healthy, to not get sick in the first place. But we also agree because of common experience. In a study of 5,000 patients, 24 percent of the patients with commercial health insurance -- meaning, they had a job -- still ran out of food or struggled to find housing or transportation or other essential resources. Twenty-four percent. And we saw the same thing in our focus groups. Nearly every voter knew what it meant to struggle, either themselves or their families or their neighbors. One of those white Republican women in Charlotte was a waitress struggling to stay awake with an enormous Big Gulp soda. She just looked exhausted. And she was. She told us that she worked two jobs but still could not afford a membership to the Y, but it was OK that she couldn't go to the gym, she said, because she also could not afford gas and walked 10 miles to and from work every single day. Listening to her, I felt this familiar panic rise in me, the residue of my own childhood. When I was 10 years old, my father lay on the living room floor in the grips of one of his many depressions. As I crouched next to him, he told me that he wanted to kill himself. My father lived, but he struggled to work. And my family survived, but we teetered, down one paycheck, relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary. Even as a little kid, I knew we lived in the shadow of financial and emotional collapse. This is really hard to say, because it's taken me 25 years to be honest with myself that this is why I do this work: knowing that my father needed health care to recover, but to be healthy, my family needed something else, we needed a decent income; and knowing, as so many do more than I, that panic when the basics threaten to slip away. To the voters in our focus groups, the solutions were straightforward. As one of those white Republican women in Charlotte said, ""Instead of putting all this money into health care, put it into affordable housing. You know, like, take it and distribute it differently."" It turns out that when you have the right language and you ask the right questions, the answers become remarkably clear and unanimous. What we know is that, despite all the noise, the plan for health care in this country is that there is no plan. But we have something more powerful than any politician's bill, any candidate's platform, any think tank's policy statement. We have our common sense and our common experience. So I ask, if you are a health care executive: Do you know how many of your patients run out of food or struggle to pay the rent at the end of the month? Is that data on your scorecard, shaping your business and your bonuses? If you are a politician: Will you continue to fight on the scorched earth of health care, or will you act on what your voters, what Democratic and Republican voters alike, already know, which is that good wages, healthy food and safe housing are health? And for the rest of us, for the citizens of this country: Will we demand accountability to what we know to be true, which is that our common sense, our common experience, makes us the experts in what it takes to be healthy? This moment, as it turns out, is not about changing minds. It is about something more powerful. It is about changing the questions we ask and quieting the noise to hear each other's answers. It is about the radical possibility that we the patients, we the physicians, we the caregivers, we the health care executives and yes, even we the people, that we agree. And it is now time -- in fact, long overdue -- for us to marshal the courage to hear those answers and to act upon them. Thank you. (Applause)"

4:56,Alex Gendler,How does impeachment work?,Sep 2018,"For most jobs, it's understood that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation  that launches a trial, which could end in conviction or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered the source of all government power. But for the founders  of the American Republic, there was no higher authority beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers, up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient  grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes  by a simple majority, the official is impeached and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House, known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official  and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president being impeached, the chief justice  of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority of two-thirds and results in automatic removal  from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them from holding office in the future and open them to standard  criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S.  pits an elected legislature against other democratically  elected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that  an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room  for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials have split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to be reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual impeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president is even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton  was impeached for making false statements under oath during a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required  two-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly be convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is  already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail."
4:32,Dread Scott,How art can shape America's conversation about freedom,Aug 2018,"I am a visual artist, and I make revolutionary art to propel history forward. I'm going to come right out and tell you something: I don't accept the economic foundation, the social relations or the governing ideas of America. My art contributes to fundamental change by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective. Social change is hard, but ideas matter tremendously. When I say I'm an artist, most people think, ""Oh, he's a painter."" Behind me, you can see some of the kind of work I do. ""Imagine a World Without America"" is a painting, but I work in a range of media, including photography, video and performance art. A current project, ""Slave Rebellion Reenactment,"" is going to be reenacted on the outskirts of New Orleans this November. In 1989, I had an artwork that became the center of controversy over its transgressive use of the American flag. ""What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"" is a conceptual work that encouraged audience participation. It consisted of a photo montage that had text that read, ""What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"" Below that were books that people could write responses to that question in, and below that was a flag that people had the option of standing on. The photo montage consisted of images of South Korean students burning American flags, holding signs that said, ""Yankee go home. Son of a bitch,"" and below that were flag-draped coffins coming back from Vietnam. People wrote long and short answers. Thousands of people engaged with the work in a lot of different languages. Some of the people said, ""I'm a German girl. If we Germans would admire our flag as you all do, we would be called Nazis again. I think you do have too much trouble about this flag."" ""I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage, i.e., the jungles of Africa, and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way."" ""This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system: the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world, including my brother who was shot by a pig, who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.' That pig was wearing the flag. Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity."" ""As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass! You should be shot!"" -- US Navy Seal Team. As you can see, people had very strong reactions about the flag then, as they do now. There were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago. They chanted things like, ""The flag and the artist, hang them both high,"" evoking images of lynching. I received numerous death threats, and bomb threats were phoned in to my school. It was a very dangerous situation. Later, President Bush called the work ""disgraceful,"" which I viewed as a tremendous honor, and Congress outlawed the work. (Laughter) I became part of a Supreme Court case when I and others defied that law, by burning flags on the steps of the Capitol. That action and the subsequent legal and political battle led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government from demanding patriotism be mandatory. But let me back up a bit. These people literally wanted me dead. What I would do at this moment would make a difference. This is me at the exact same moment, eight stories above that crowd. It was supposed to be for a photo shoot that was going to take place on the steps where the veterans were at that time. It wouldn't have been safe for me to be there, to say the least. But it was really important to do that shoot, because while some wanted to kill me, it was also a situation where those who viewed the American flag as standing for everything oppressive in this system felt that they had a voice, and that voice needed to be amplified. The point is this: changing anything -- whether it's conventional ideas about US national symbols, traditional thinking challenged by scientific breakthroughs or ousting an authoritarian president -- requires a lot of things. It requires courage, luck and also vision and boldness of action. But on luck -- I have to say, the photo shoot we did might not have worked out so well. We laughed after we were out of the area. But the thing is, it was worth the risk because of the stakes that were involved. And in this case, the luck led to a wonderful, profound and powerful situation that was also humorous. Thank you. (Applause)"
11:04,Janet Stovall,How to get serious about diversity and inclusion in the workplace,Aug 2018,"Everybody has that one friend -- you know, the single-minded one, the one who, no matter what the question is, always finds a way to make the answer whatever it is she's single-minded about. I'm that friend. (Laughter) And the thing that I'm single-minded about is racism. If someone were to ask me, ""So, Janet, got any plans for the 4th of July?"" I'm subject to answer, ""Yeah, I'm going to binge-watch 'Roots.'"" (Laughter) Or if they said, ""Janet, I've got a joke for you: Why'd the chicken cross the road?"" ""Uh, was it a black chicken? Probably gentrification."" (Laughter) (Applause) But for me, single-mindedness is not just caring about something. It's caring about something enough to do something about it. It's not just thinking, it's doing. It's not just praying, it is moving your feet. And the reason I'm single-minded about racism is because I know single-mindedness can destroy it. I learned that many, many years ago. Back in 1984, I was a junior at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina. Now, Davidson is a little-bitty town, Southern town, split by railroad tracks, with white Davidson on one side, black Davidson on the other side, and, as black students lived on the white side of the tracks, we got used to being stopped in downtown and asked for ID, until the police memorized our faces. But fortunately, that didn't take too long, because out of 1,200 students, only 52 of us were black. There was one black professor and one black assistant dean. Things weren't a lot better on campus. Well, I wasn't OK with this. And so, I started writing things. And then I started yelling things. And after about three years of that, I got tired. So I decided to write one more thing; I wrote something called ""Project '87."" Project '87 was really just a challenge to Davidson: in three years, by 1987, enroll 100 black students, hire 10 black professors, create five Black Studies classes and hire one black dean. It didn't seem particularly revolutionary, but what was different about it was, we also challenged Davidson to say that if you don't do this, we will question your commitment to diversity. It was a real problem. We put some real numbers to it. We gave them some real consequences. Well, the campus went absolutely nuts. But fortunately, in the middle of this, Davidson got a new president, and that president was single-minded about racism, too. And so, he created a task force to address the issues in Project '87. And several months after that, we produced a 77-page report. That report was the foundation for all the change that came after it. Now, I wasn't there to see that change, because, actually, in 1985, I graduated. (Applause) You are looking at the three happiest people on the planet that day, because I am leaving. (Laughter) However, the change did happen, and today, there are 185 black students, there are 16 black or multiracial professors, there are four black deans, and there's an entire degree-granting Africana Studies Department. (Applause) Project '87 changed Davidson. But it also changed me, because what it taught me was there's a lot of power in single-mindedness. Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter for one of the biggest companies in the world. It's a profession that is 92 percent white and predominantly male, which makes me a little bit of a unicorn. But I'm a single-minded unicorn. (Laughter) So the thing about speech writing is, it's very personal. So I spend a lot of time in deep conversation with the CEO and senior executives, and a lot of times those conversations turn to diversity and inclusion, which, of course, I'm always happy to talk about. But after quite a few of these conversations, I've come to a conclusion: I believe that business is in a position to do something that no other entity can do. Business can dismantle racism. Now, colleges can't do it. There aren't but 5,000 of them in the United States and only 20 million students enrolled. Church can't do it, either -- only 35 percent of us go on a regular basis, and when we do, eleven o'clock Sunday morning is ""the most segregated hour"" in America. But business? There are a 162 million people in the US workforce alone -- people of all races, united in the spirit of wanting a paycheck and having to show up to get it. (Laughter) Now, I'm aware that diversity is bigger than race, and racism is bigger than America. But racial discrimination is the most prominent form, and Lord knows America is the absolute best at it. So what if, though, what if we worked in diverse and inclusive environments that we had something to do something with? And since we spend one-third of our lives at work, what if we did that with people who didn't look like us? I think the world would be a totally different place outside of work. That can happen if business gets single-minded about racism. But the question is: How is that supposed to happen? Well, I think there are three things that business can borrow from Project '87: real problems, real numbers, real consequences. Like it or not, diversity is not really a problem for business -- yet. I mean, it's a nice thing to have, it's the right thing to do, but for decades, we've been trying to make the case that diversity fuels innovation and customer insight. I mean, at this point, it's kind of a no-brainer, a little bit like hearing a smoke alarm going off and standing with your hand on the hot door, waiting for some data to tell you that your house is on fire. Because the data is already there. Ethnically diverse companies perform 33 percent better than the norm. Forbes's best workplaces for diversity enjoy 24 percent higher revenue growth. And yet, here we are in 2018, and there are only three black CEOs in the Fortune 500. And if your name is Molly or Connor, you've got a 14 percent better chance of getting a callback on your resume than if your name is Shanice or DeShawn. And all of this, despite the fact that by 2045, America is projected to be a minority-majority country. Here's the thing: the business case for diversity, as it stands today, doesn't really speak to any problem. And the only way business is going to get single-minded about racial diversity is if it has a problem that is urgent and relative to somebody other than people of color. I got one: How about employees and customers? Because no matter what business you're in, you're going to need those, right? Well, let's talk about some real numbers. If you have employees and customers, wouldn't it make sense if they looked a little bit like the people that work for you? So if that's the case, maybe your employee base should be 13 percent Black and 18 percent Hispanic, because that's what the population looks like. Maybe that's what your customer base looks like. But let's be clear: diversity and inclusion are not the same things. Diversity is a numbers game. Inclusion is about impact. Companies can mandate diversity, but they have to cultivate inclusion. And if inclusion is what you're after, you've got to calculate some slightly different numbers. How about 30 percent? Because that's the point that research shows at which the voices of minorities actually begin to be heard. If you want a real problem, you're going to need real numbers to fix it, and if you're not willing to set real numbers, then maybe you're not real serious about diversity and inclusion. That brings me to my third point: real consequences. Think about this: when salespeople forget what they're doing and don't come up with their numbers, what do we do? We give them a little time, maybe we give them some training. But then if they don't hit those numbers eventually, we fire them. However, when you start talking about diversity and inclusion, we use terms like ""accountability."" And maybe we scold, and maybe we hold back an incentive or two. But you know what the best incentive is? A job. And you know what the best disincentive is? Losing it. So if companies really want accountability, they should assume that that is a given. Consequences are what happen when you don't do what you're accountable for. Imagine this: imagine a place where people of all colors and all races are on and climbing every rung of the corporate ladder; where those people feel safe -- indeed, expected -- to bring their unassimilated, authentic selves to work every day, because the difference that they bring is both recognized and respected. And imagine a place where the lessons we learn about diversity at work actually transform the things we do, think and say outside of work. That is what happens if we all work together to fix what's broken. That is what happens if we stop praying for change to happen and actually start moving our feet to making it. That is the power of single-mindedness. Thank you. (Applause)"
14:43,Lindsay Malloy,Why teens confess to crimes they didn't commit,Jul 2018,"Tyler Edmonds, Bobby Johnson, Davontae Sanford, Marty Tankleff, Jeffrey Deskovic, Anthony Caravella and Travis Hayes. You probably don't recognize their faces. Together, they served 89 years for murders that they didn't commit; murders that they falsely confessed to committing when they were teenagers. I'm a forensic developmental psychologist, and I study these types of cases. As a researcher, a professor and a new parent, my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults. In March of 2006, police interrogated Brendan Dassey, a 16-year-old high school student with an IQ around 70, putting him in the range of intellectual disability. So here's just a brief snippet of his four-hour interrogation. (Video) Police 1: Brendan, be honest. I told you before that's the only thing that's going to help you here. We already know what happened, OK? Police 2: If we don't get honesty here -- I'm your friend right now, but I've got to believe in you, and if I don't believe in you, I can't go to bat for you. OK? You're nodding. Tell us what happened. P1: Your mom said you'd be honest with us. P2: And she's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here. P1: That's what she said, because she thinks you know more, too. P2: We're in your corner. P1: We already know what happened, now tell us exactly. Don't lie. Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan that honesty would ""set him free,"" but they were completely convinced of his guilt at that point. So by honesty, they meant a confession, and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free. They eventually got a confession from Brendan that didn't really make sense, didn't match much of the physical evidence of the crime and is widely believed to be false. Still, it was enough to convict Brendan and sentence him to life in prison for murder and sexual assault in 2007. There was no physical evidence against Brendan at all. It was nothing more than his own words that sent him to prison for nearly a decade, until a judge overturned his conviction just a few months ago. The Dassey case is unique because it made its way into a Netflix series, called ""Making a Murderer,"" which I'm sure many of you saw, and if you haven't, you should definitely watch it. The Dassey case is also unique because it led to such intense public outrage. People were very angry about how Brendan was questioned, and many assumed that his interrogation had to have been illegal. It wasn't illegal. As someone who's a researcher in this area and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals, I wasn't really surprised by what I saw. The fact is, Dassey's interrogation itself is actually not all that unique, and to be honest with you, I've seen worse. So I understand the public outcry about injustice in Brendan Dassey's individual case. But let's not forget that approximately one million or so of his peers are arrested every year in the United States and may be subjected to similar interrogation techniques, techniques that we know increase the risk for false confession. And I know many people are going to struggle with that term, ""false confession,"" and with believing that false confessions actually occur. And I get that. It's very shocking and counterintuitive: Why would someone confess and even give gruesome details about a horrifying crime like rape or murder if they hadn't actually done it? It makes no sense. And the fact is, we can never know precisely how often false confessions occur. But what we do know is that false confessions or admissions were present in approximately 25 percent of wrongful convictions of people later exonerated by DNA evidence. Turns out, they were innocent. These cases are crystal clear because we have the DNA. So they didn't do the crime, and yet one-quarter of them confessed to it anyway. And at this point, from countless research studies, we have a pretty good sense of why people falsely confess, and why some people, like Brendan Dassey, are at greater risk for doing so. We know that youth are especially vulnerable to providing false confessions. In one study of exonerations, for example, only eight percent of adults had falsely confessed, but 42 percent of juveniles had done so. Of course, if we're just looking at wrongful convictions and exonerations, we're only getting part of the story. Left out, for instance, are the many cases that are resolved by guilty pleas, not trials. From TV and news headlines, you may think that trials are the norm in our legal system, but the reality is that 97 percent of legal cases in the US are resolved by pleas, not trials. Ninety-seven percent. Also left out will be confessions to more minor types of crimes that don't typically involve DNA evidence and aren't usually reviewed or appealed following a conviction. So for this reason, many refer to the false confessions we actually do know about as the tip of a much larger iceberg. In our research, we found alarming rates of false confession among teenagers. We interviewed almost 200 incarcerated 14-to-17-year-olds, and 17 percent of them reported that they'd made at least one false confession to police. What's also shocking to most is that, in interrogations in the US, police are allowed to interrogate juveniles just like adults. So they can lie to them -- blatant lies like, ""We have your fingerprints, we have your DNA; your friend is down the hall saying that this was all your idea."" Lying to suspects is banned in the UK, for example, but legal here in the US, even with intellectually impaired teens like Brendan Dassey. In our research, most of the incarcerated teens that we interviewed reported experiencing high-pressure police interrogations without lawyers or parents present. More than 80 percent described having been threatened by the police, including with the possibility of being raped or killed in jail or being tried as an adult. These maximization strategies are designed to make suspects feel like denials are pointless and confession is the only option. So you may have heard of playing the role of ""good cop/bad cop,"" right? Well, this is bad cop. Juveniles are more suggestible and susceptible to social influence, like the intense pressure accusations and suggestions coming from authority figures in interrogations. More than 70 percent of the teens in our study said that the police had tried to ""befriend"" them or indicate a desire to help them out during the interrogation. These are referred to as ""minimization strategies,"" and they're designed to convey sympathy and understanding to the suspect, and they imply that a confession will result in more lenient treatment. So in the classic good-cop-bad-cop oversimplification of police interrogations, this is ""good cop."" (Video) P1: Honesty here, Brendan, is the thing that's going to help you, OK? No matter what you did, we can work through that, OK? We can't make any promises, but we'll stand behind you no matter what you did, OK? LM: ""No matter what you did, we can work through that."" Hints of leniency like you just saw with Brendan are especially powerful among adolescents, in part because they evaluate reward and risk differently than adults do. Confessing brings an immediate reward to the suspect, right? Now the stressful, unpleasant interrogation is over. So confessing may seem like the best option to most teens, who are less focused on that long-term risk of conviction and punishment down the road as a result of that confession. I think we can all agree that thoughtful, long-term planning is not a strength of most teenagers that we know. And by and large, the legal system seems to get that young victims and witnesses should be treated differently than adults. But when it comes to young suspects, it's like the kid gloves come off. And treating juveniles as though they're adults in interrogations is a problem, because literally hundreds of psychological and neuroscientific studies tell us that juveniles do not think like adults, they do not behave like adults, and they're not built like adults. Adolescent brains are different from adult brains -- even anatomically. So there are important changes happening in the structure and function of the brain during adolescence, especially in the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system, and these are areas that are crucial for things like self-control, decision-making, emotion processing and regulation and sensitivity to reward and risk, all of which can affect how you function in a stressful circumstance, like a police interrogation. We need to educate law enforcement, attorneys, judges and jurors on juveniles' developmental limitations and how they can play out in a high-stakes interrogation. In one national survey of police officers, 75 percent of them actually requested specialized training in how to talk to children and adolescents -- most of them had had none. We also need to consider having special protections in place for juveniles. In his 91-page decision to overturn Dassey's conviction earlier this year, the judge made a big deal about the fact that Dassey had no parent or other allied adult in the interrogation room with him. So here's a clip of Brendan talking to his mom after he confessed, when it was obviously far too late for him. (Video) Mom: What do you mean? Brendan: Like, if his story is, like, different, like I never did nothing or something. M: Did you? Huh? B: Not really. M: What do you mean, ""Not really""? B: They got into my head. LM: So he sums it up pretty beautifully there: ""They got into my head."" We don't know if the outcome would have been different for Brendan if his mom had been in the interrogation room with him. But it's certainly possible. In our research, only seven percent of incarcerated teens, most of whom had had numerous encounters with police, had ever had a parent or attorney in the room with them when they were questioned as a suspect. Few had ever asked for a parent or attorney to be present. And you see this in lower-stake situations, too. We did a mock interrogation experiment in our lab here at FIU -- with parent permission for all minors, of course, and all the appropriate ethical approvals. We falsely accused teens and adults of cheating on a study task -- an academic dishonesty offense -- that we told them was as serious as cheating in a class. In reality, participants had witnessed a peer cheat, someone who was actually part of our research team and was allegedly on academic probation. And we gave everyone a tough choice: you can lose your extra credit for participating in the study or accuse your peer, who will probably be expelled because of his academic probation status. Of course, in reality, none of these consequences would have panned out, and we fully debriefed all of the participants afterward. But most teenagers -- 59 percent of them -- signed the confession statement, falsely taking responsibility for the cheating. Only three teens out of 74, or about four percent of them, asked to talk to a parent when we accused them of cheating, despite the fact that for most of them, their parent was literally sitting in the next room during the study. Of course, cheating is far from murder, and I know that. But it's interesting that so many teens, significantly more teens than adults, signed the confession saying that they cheated. They hadn't cheated, but they signed this form anyway saying that they had, rarely attempting to involve a parent in the situation. Other studies tell the same story. Over 90 percent of juveniles waive their Miranda rights and submit to police questioning without lawyers or parents present. In England and Wales, interrogations of juveniles must be conducted in the presence of an ""appropriate adult,"" like a parent, guardian or social worker. And this isn't something youth have to ask for -- which is great, because research shows that they won't -- it's automatic. Now, having an appropriate adult safeguard for juveniles here in the US would not be a cure-all for improving police questioning of youth. Unfortunately, parents often lack the knowledge and legal sophistication to appropriately advise their children. You can just look at the case of the Central Park Five: five teenagers who falsely confessed to a brutal gang rape in 1989, with their parents by their sides. And it took over a decade to clear their names. So the appropriate adult really should be an attorney or perhaps a trained child advocate. Overturning Dassey's conviction, the judge pointed out that there's no federal law requiring that the police even inform a juvenile's parent that the juvenile is being questioned or honor that juvenile's request to have a parent in the room. So if you think about all of this together for a second: as a country, we've decided that juveniles cannot be trusted with things like voting, buying cigarettes, attending an R-rated movie or driving, but they can make the judgment call to waive their Miranda rights, rights that we know from research, most teens don't understand or appreciate. And parents in the room: depending on the state that you live in, your child can potentially waive these rights without your knowledge and without consulting any adult first. Now, no one -- and certainly not me -- wants to prevent police from doing the very important investigative work that they do every day. But we need to make sure that they have appropriate training for talking to youth. As a parent and as a researcher, I think we can do better. I think we can take steps to prevent another Brendan Dassey, while still getting the crucial information that we need from children and teens to solve crimes. Thank you. (Applause)"
13:10,Oskar Eustis,Why theater is essential to democracy,Jun 2018,"Theater matters because democracy matters. Theater is the essential art form of democracy, and we know this because they were born in the same city. In the late 6th century BC, the idea of Western democracy was born. It was, of course, a very partial and flawed democracy, but the idea that power should stem from the consent of the governed, that power should flow from below to above, not the other way around, was born in that decade. And in that same decade, somebody -- legend has it, somebody named Thespis -- invented the idea of dialogue. What does that mean, to invent dialogue? Well, we know that the Festival of Dionysus gathered the entire citizenry of Athens on the side of the Acropolis, and they would listen to music, they would watch dancing, and they would have stories told as part of the Festival of Dionysus. And storytelling is much like what's happening right now: I'm standing up here, the unitary authority, and I am talking to you. And you are sitting back, and you are receiving what I have to say. And you may disagree with it, you may think I'm an insufferable fool, you may be bored to death, but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head. But what happens if, instead of me talking to you -- and Thespis thought of this -- I just shift 90 degrees to the left, and I talk to another person onstage with me? Everything changes, because at that moment, I'm not the possessor of truth; I'm a guy with an opinion. And I'm talking to somebody else. And you know what? That other person has an opinion too, and it's drama, remember, conflict -- they disagree with me. There's a conflict between two points of view. And the thesis of that is that the truth can only emerge in the conflict of different points of view. It's not the possession of any one person. And if you believe in democracy, you have to believe that. If you don't believe that, you're an autocrat who is putting up with democracy. But that's the basic thesis of democracy, that the conflict of different points of views leads to the truth. What's the other thing that's happening? I'm not asking you to sit back and listen to me. I'm asking you to lean forward and imagine my point of view -- what this looks like and feels like to me as a character. And then I'm asking you to switch your mind and imagine what it feels like to the other person talking. I'm asking you to exercise empathy. And the idea that truth comes from the collision of different ideas and the emotional muscle of empathy are the necessary tools for democratic citizenship. What else happens? The third thing really is you, is the community itself, is the audience. And you know from personal experience that when you go to the movies, you walk into a movie theater, and if it's empty, you're delighted, because nothing's going to be between you and the movie. You can spread out, put your legs over the top of the stadium seats, eat your popcorn and just enjoy it. But if you walk into a live theater and you see that the theater is half full, your heart sinks. You're disappointed immediately, because whether you knew it or not, you were coming to that theater to be part of an audience. You were coming to have the collective experience of laughing together, crying together, holding your breath together to see what's going to happen next. You may have walked into that theater as an individual consumer, but if the theater does its job, you've walked out with a sense of yourself as part of a whole, as part of a community. That's built into the DNA of my art form. Twenty-five hundred years later, Joe Papp decided that the culture should belong to everybody in the United States of America, and that it was his job to try to deliver on that promise. He created Free Shakespeare in the Park. And Free Shakespeare in the Park is based on a very simple idea, the idea that the best theater, the best art that we can produce, should go to everybody and belong to everybody, and to this day, every summer night in Central Park, 2,000 people are lining up to see the best theater we can provide for free. It's not a commercial transaction. In 1967, 13 years after he figured that out, he figured out something else, which is that the democratic circle was not complete by just giving the people the classics. We had to actually let the people create their own classics and take the stage. And so in 1967, Joe opened the Public Theater downtown on Astor Place, and the first show he ever produced was the world premiere of ""Hair."" That's the first thing he ever did that wasn't Shakespeare. Clive Barnes in The Times said that it was as if Mr. Papp took a broom and swept up all the refuse from the East Village streets onto the stage at the Public. (Laughter) He didn't mean it complimentarily, but Joe put it up in the lobby, he was so proud of it. (Laughter) (Applause) And what the Public Theater did over the next years with amazing shows like ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf,"" ""A Chorus Line,"" and -- here's the most extraordinary example I can think of: Larry Kramer's savage cry of rage about the AIDS crisis, ""The Normal Heart."" Because when Joe produced that play in 1985, there was more information about AIDS in Frank Rich's review in the New York Times than the New York Times had published in the previous four years. Larry was actually changing the dialogue about AIDS through writing this play, and Joe was by producing it. I was blessed to commission and work on Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America,"" and when doing that play and along with ""Normal Heart,"" we could see that the culture was actually shifting, and it wasn't caused by the theater, but the theater was doing its part to change what it meant to be gay in the United States. And I'm incredibly proud of that. (Applause) When I took over Joe's old job at the Public in 2005, I realized one of the problems we had was a victim of our own success, which is: Shakespeare in the Park had been founded as a program for access, and it was now the hardest ticket to get in New York City. People slept out for two nights to get those tickets. What was that doing? That was eliminating 98 percent of the population from even considering going to it. So we refounded the mobile unit and took Shakespeare to prisons, to homeless shelters, to community centers in all five boroughs and even in New Jersey and Westchester County. And that program proved something to us that we knew intuitively: people's need for theater is as powerful as their desire for food or for drink. It's been an extraordinary success, and we've continued it. And then there was yet another barrier that we realized we weren't crossing, which is a barrier of participation. And the idea, we said, is: How can we turn theater from being a commodity, an object, back into what it really is -- a set of relationships among people? And under the guidance of the amazing Lear deBessonet, we started the Public Works program, which now every summer produces these immense Shakespearean musical pageants, where Tony Award-winning actors and musicians are side by side with nannies and domestic workers and military veterans and recently incarcerated prisoners, amateurs and professionals, performing together on the same stage. And it's not just a great social program, it's the best art that we do. And the thesis of it is that artistry is not something that is the possession of a few. Artistry is inherent in being a human being. Some of us just get to spend a lot more of our lives practicing it. And then occasionally -- (Applause) you get a miracle like ""Hamilton,"" Lin-Manuel's extraordinary retelling of the foundational story of this country through the eyes of the only Founding Father who was a bastard immigrant orphan from the West Indies. And what Lin was doing is exactly what Shakespeare was doing. He was taking the voice of the people, the language of the people, elevating it into verse, and by doing so, ennobling the language and ennobling the people who spoke the language. And by casting that show entirely with a cast of black and brown people, what Lin was saying to us, he was reviving in us our greatest aspirations for the United States, our better angels of America, our sense of what this country could be, the inclusion that was at the heart of the American Dream. And it unleashed a wave of patriotism in me and in our audience, the appetite for which is proving to be insatiable. But there was another side to that, and it's where I want to end, and it's the last story I want to talk about. Some of you may have heard that Vice President-elect Pence came to see ""Hamilton"" in New York. And when he came in, some of my fellow New Yorkers booed him. And beautifully, he said, ""That's what freedom sounds like."" And at the end of the show, we read what I feel was a very respectful statement from the stage, and Vice President-elect Pence listened to it, but it sparked a certain amount of outrage, a tweetstorm, and also an internet boycott of ""Hamilton"" from outraged people who had felt we had treated him with disrespect. I looked at that boycott and I said, we're getting something wrong here. All of these people who have signed this boycott petition, they were never going to see ""Hamilton"" anyway. It was never going to come to a city near them. If it could come, they couldn't afford a ticket, and if they could afford a ticket, they didn't have the connections to get that ticket. They weren't boycotting us; we had boycotted them. And if you look at the red and blue electoral map of the United States, and if I were to tell you, ""Oh, the blue is what designates all of the major nonprofit cultural institutions,"" I'd be telling you the truth. You'd believe me. We in the culture have done exactly what the economy, what the educational system, what technology has done, which is turn our back on a large part of the country. So this idea of inclusion, it has to keep going. Next fall, we are sending out on tour a production of Lynn Nottage's brilliant, Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Sweat."" Years of research in Redding, Pennsylvania led her to write this play about the deindustrialization of Pennsylvania: what happened when steel left, the rage that was unleashed, the tensions that were unleashed, the racism that was unleashed by the loss of jobs. We're taking that play and we're touring it to rural counties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. We're partnering with community organizations there to try and make sure not only that we reach the people that we're trying to reach, but that we find ways to listen to them back and say, ""The culture is here for you, too."" Because -- (Applause) we in the culture industry, we in the theater, have no right to say that we don't know what our job is. It's in the DNA of our art form. Our job ""... is to hold up, as 'twere, a mirror to nature; to show scorn her image, to show virtue her appearance, and the very age its form and pressure."" Our job is to try to hold up a vision to America that shows not only who all of us are individually, but that welds us back into the commonality that we need to be, the sense of unity, the sense of whole, the sense of who we are as a country. That's what the theater is supposed to do, and that's what we need to try to do as well as we can. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
11:27,Erricka Bridgeford,How Baltimore called a ceasefire,May 2018,"There is a pastor in Baltimore. His name is Michael Phillips, he is the pastor of Kingdom Life Church, and he often talks about how problems show up in our lives so arrogantly, with so much confidence, as if there is just nothing we can do about them. And the murder rate in Baltimore had been doing that. Year after year, it just kept showing up as this big thing that there was nothing any of us could do anything about. But the thing about Baltimore is that it has never been the one to just be defeated. So the story about the Baltimore Ceasefire is that Baltimore looked the murder rate in the eye and said, ""What you're not going to do is snatch our greatness."" So two years ago, I'm at a 300 Man March meeting. At the time, I was a leader in that movement. And this guy named Ogun -- he's like a godfather of hip-hop in Baltimore -- he came over to me and he said, ""Yo, I have this idea about calling a ceasefire in Baltimore, and I feel like you are somebody I should talk to about that."" And I was like, ""I'm absolutely somebody you should talk to about that, because that's something we should do."" And so we played phone tag and meeting tag, and two years went by and we never really sat down and talked about it. So now we're in May of 2017. My son Paul, he's 19 years old, he's driving me home from work one day, and he says, ""Ma, did you know that the murder rate in Baltimore is higher than it's ever been?"" And I said, ""What you mean it's higher than it's ever been? How is that possible? Like, I mean, what about people who say they have connections to the streets? Why won't they use those connections and call a cease-fire or something?"" And on and on I went from my own feelings of helplessness about what other people weren't doing. The next morning I woke up and I realized that what I was really angry about wasn't about what other people weren't doing, it was that I had heard this message years ago, and I hadn't moved on it. So it was about what I was supposed to be doing. So I got up and I'm going, ""OK, if we could just have three days where everybody in the city was committing, nobody is going to kill anybody, and we're going to celebrate life instead, when can we do that?"" So it's May, I look at my calendar, all right, I've got some free time the first weekend in August, we'll do it August 4th through August 6th, right? So I'm all excited, I start driving to work, and the more I drive, the scareder I get. And so I start going, ""Never mind ... (Laughter) I won't say this thing out loud. Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it."" But it wouldn't let me go, because God loves to show up as us, and because I look broken and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness, there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud. And because my city looks broken and is always yearning to show up in its wholeness, there were hearts that morning calling all through my chest that people around this city wanted to do something great together. And people who had already been killed in my city were calling to me up through my gut and my chest, as a knot in my throat, ""Yo, E, you cannot just let us be dead in vain when you know how to say this thing out loud."" And I responded to them with my fear. ""But somebody might get killed anyway that weekend."" And that was the moment where I had to accept that maybe while we're out spreading this message -- ""Hey, nobody's going to kill anybody. We're going to celebrate life!"" -- maybe somebody will be plotting to take a life right then and there, but now they would have a rumbling in their spirit. And so I knew it was time for my city to have a collective rumbling in our spirit. So I got on the phone, got around to Ogun, and I said, ""Yo, you said you wanted to do a cease-fire? What is it? I'm ready."" So he said, ""You know, when I hear about the Israelis and Palestinians at war, I'm like, that's too bad, they should stop that, but when I hear the word 'cease-fire,' that makes me pause and stop and really research what's going on."" And he wanted Baltimore to get that same kind of attention from the outside, but introspection from the inside about what was going on with us. And we talked about how it couldn't belong to one person. Not one person or one organization should call a cease-fire. The whole city had to own it and do it together. So we had our first meeting in May. About 12 or 15 people show up, and this is where it gets named the Baltimore Ceasefire, because you know what that means when you hear the word ""cease-fire."" Just don't kill nobody. And this is where the Baltimore Peace Challenge was born. Because it's not just about not being violent. It is about being purposefully peaceful. What is going on in your thoughts? What kind of petty things are you not saying out of your mouth? How are you responding in your behaviors to conflict? I grabbed up five people who I trusted, and the six of us became the organizing squad. So let's give them props real quick. On the count of three, I want you to yell ""squad."" One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad! And it's Shellers's birthday. Happy birthday, Shellers. Audience: Happy birthday! And so we put out a press release, and the media told us, this is not really a story yet, we will get with you on August 7th to see how the cease-fire went. So we went, ""Oh, word? Oh, all right then."" And Baltimore got to work, and not only did people send money to the PayPal account so we could buy flyers and posters, people came and got the flyers and posters and they put them all around the city, and people were having conversations with each other. What kind of resources do you need? What are you going through? What has happened to you? Because we understand the root causes of violence in this country. People who said it wouldn't work still ended their sentence with ""but please keep trying. Somebody needs to do something anyway."" Teenagers who would tell us about the stuff they were doing in the streets all day asked, ""But can I have a poster to put it on my wall at night so I can see it on my way to bed?"" Gangsters were calling, saying, ""I can tell you where violence is not going to come from, because we're committing to the Peace Challenge."" And they kept their word. When people said, ""It's not going to work, because somebody's going to kill over West or over East,"" we said, ""That doesn't matter. It's about self-determination, yo. You telling me you can't keep this three- or six-block radius safe?"" And they would say, ""Don't get it twisted. It's going to stay safe around here."" And they kept their promise. (Applause) Four songs -- and I know it looks like I'm holding up five fingers, but I have four fingers, so this is four for me -- four songs got made about the Baltimore Ceasefire, and the one that most exemplifies it, where a bunch of artists came together and made a song, that one is currently nominated for a Grammy out here. Right? And so now what was happening was from the most beautiful corners of crack houses to the grimiest corners of politicians' offices, everybody -- (Laughter) was talking about this thing Baltimore was doing together. Right? And then, the weekend came: events all over the city, people yelling ""Happy Ceasefire Day!"" Over 200 people got their records expunged and got jobs, and people went into drug recovery programs because of what was happening in our city that weekend. People were going, ""But the air feels different in Baltimore. Nobody's mother got that phone call last night. I didn't hear any gunshots."" And on Saturday, Trey went to go get a job and was excited about it. At 24 hours of no killing, we were singing Kendrick Lamar. ""We gon' be alright. We gon' be alright."" And then at 4:59 on Saturday, we get a message that somebody was killed. We didn't know his name, but it turned out to be Trey. So we rushed over to Sargeant Street, and we held hands in a circle and we looked at the pavement, and we said, ""This is sacred ground because we make it so, because everywhere in our city where people lose their lives to violence needs to be sacred ground."" And it wasn't just about upholding Trey and his transition and sending love to his family. It was about us pausing to really think about what must it feel like 20 minutes after you kill somebody? Can't we pour love into that? Because until we do, we will not heal this epidemic. Later on in the day, we get another call. Dante is murdered. So by the end of this day, we were shook. In real life, we were shook, because we had opened up our hearts together and changed the atmosphere of this city, and now our hearts were broken together. And we had to be honest about the fact that last weekend, when we lost six people to violence, it didn't feel the way it felt this weekend when we lost these two, because now we were paying attention. Now we were all hoping together that nobody got killed. And so we had to make a vow with ourselves not to be numb anymore when we lose people in our city. These two lives were going to remind us to vibrate higher and to move forward. So as we move forward into Baltimore Ceasefire 365, because there's work that needs to be done all year, and there's another cease-fire happening next weekend, November 3rd through 5th. Mark your calendar. (Applause) Right? And we expect the same thing. It was news media from all around the world, Australia and Norway and China. Everybody wanted to come get this work from Baltimore, and y'all could come get it. Right? So as we push forward, we don't need to keep asking now ""What can we do?"" We have seen the power of collective consciousness. Y'all were the ones who misunderstood Baltimore. Y'all thought Baltimore was just ""The Wire."" When we lost Freddie Gray, y'all saw the Baltimore uprising, and people around this world mischaracterized it and misunderstood it. What you failed to realize is Baltimore is the power to rise up, and that is what we continue to do. (Applause) And so as we move forward, we see you, America, with your systems of violent oppression trying to beat us into the ground, and still, we rise. We rise and stand with cities all over this country just like us who are handed, through no fault of their own, criminal conditions in which to live, and then they get labeled savages for how they live. We stand with them. We remind them we are an example of what you can do when you say, ""No, I don't have to accept these conditions that you are trying to hand me. I get to decide what the greatest vision of myself looks like. And so the next time you are faced with a dilemma, with a problem, you can say, ""Let me be like Baltimore, let me look it in the face, let me tell it."" But what you're not going to do is snatch my greatness. Please believe it. Thank you. (Applause)"
12:22,Priya Vulchi and Winona Guo,What it takes to be racially literate,May 2018,"Priya Vulchi: Four years ago, we really thought we understood racism. Just like many of you here today, we had experienced and heard stories about race, about prejudice, discrimination and stereotyping and we were like, ""We get it, racism, we got it, we got it."" But we weren't even close. Winona Guo: So we decided that we had to listen and learn more. We talked to as many random people as we could and collected hundreds of personal stories about race, stories that revealed how racial injustice is a nationwide epidemic that we ourselves spread and now can't seem to recognize or get rid of. PV: We're not there yet. Today, we are here to raise our standards of racial literacy, to redefine what it means to be racially literate. WG: We want everywhere across the United States for our youngest and future generations to grow up equipped with the tools to understand, navigate and improve a world structured by racial division. We want us all to imagine the community as a place where we not only feel proud of our own backgrounds, but can also invest in others' experiences as if they were our own. PV: We just graduated from high school this past June. WG: And you'd think -- (Applause) And you'd think after 12 years somebody in or out of the classroom would have helped us understand -- PV: At a basic level at least -- WG: The society we live in. PV: The truth for almost all our classmates is that they don't. WG: In communities around our country, so many of which are racially divided, PV: If you don't go searching for an education about race, for racial literacy -- WG: You won't get it. It won't just come to you. PV: Even when we did have conversations about race, our understanding was always superficial. We realized that there are two big gaps in our racial literacy. WG: First, the heart gap: an inability to understand each of our experiences, to fiercely and unapologetically be compassionate beyond lip service. PV: And second, the mind gap: an inability to understand the larger, systemic ways in which racism operates. WG: First, the heart gap. To be fair, race did pop up a few times in school, growing up. We all defend our social justice education because we learned about Martin Luther King Jr. and Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks. But even in all of those conversations, race always felt outdated, like, ""Yes, slavery, that happened once upon a time, but why does it really matter now?"" As a result, we didn't really care. But what if our teacher introduced a story from the present day, for example, how Treniya told us in Pittsburgh that -- PV: ""My sister was scrolling through Facebook and typed in our last name. This white guy popped up, and we found out that his great-great-grandfather owned slaves and my great-great- great-grandmother was one of them. My last name -- it's not who I am. We've been living under a white man's name. If slavery didn't happen, who would I even be?"" WG: Now it feels relevant, immediate, because the connection to slavery's lasting legacy today is made clear, right? Or what would happen is our teacher would throw out these cold statistics. You've probably seen this one before in news headlines. PV: African-Americans are incarcerated more than five times the rate of white people. WG: Now consider Ronnie, in Seattle. PV: ""My father means everything to me. He's all I've got, I don't know my mother. My father's currently being wrongly incarcerated for 12 years. I've got a daughter, and I try to be that same fatherly figure for her: always involved in everything she does, it might even be annoying at some points. But I'm afraid I'll go missing in her life just like my father did in mine."" WG: Throwing out just the statistic, just the facts alone, disconnected from real humans, can lead to dangerously incomplete understanding of those facts. It fails to recognize that for many people who don't understand racism the problem is not a lack of knowledge to talk about the pain of white supremacy and oppression, it's that they don't recognize that that pain exists at all. They don't recognize the human beings that are being affected, and they don't feel enough to care. PV: Second, the mind gap. We can't ignore the stats, either. We can't truly grasp Ronnie's situation without understanding how things like unjust laws and biased policing systematic racism has created the disproportionate incarceration rates over time. Or like how in Honolulu, the large prison population of native Hawaiians like Kimmy is heavily influenced by the island's long history with US colonialization, its impact passing down through generations to today. For us, sometimes we would talk about people's personal, unique experiences in the classroom. Stuff like, how Justin once told us -- WG: ""I've been working on psychologically reclaiming my place in this city. Because for me, my Chicago isn't the nice architecture downtown, it's not the North Side. My Chicago is the orange line, the pink line, the working immigrant class going on the train."" PV: And while we might have acknowledged his personal experience, we wouldn't have talked about how redlining and the legalized segregation of our past created the racially divided neighborhoods we live in today. We wouldn't have completely understood how racism is embedded in the framework of everything around us, because we would stay narrowly focused on people's isolated experiences. Another example, Sandra in DC once told us: WG: ""When I'm with my Korean family, I know how to move with them. I know what to do in order to have them feel like I care about them. And making and sharing food is one of the most fundamental ways of showing love. When I'm with my partner who's not Korean, however, we've had to grapple with the fact that I'm very food-centric and he's just not. One time he said that he didn't want to be expected to make food for me, and I got really upset."" PV: That might seem like a weird reaction, but only if we don't recognize how it's emblematic of something larger, something deeper. Intragenerational trauma. How in Sandra's family, widespread hunger and poverty existed as recently as Sandra's parents' generation and therefore impacts Sandra today. She experiences someone saying -- WG: ""I don't want to feed you."" PV: As -- WG: ""I don't want to hug you."" PV: And without her and her partner having that nuanced understanding of her reaction and the historical context behind it, it could easily lead to unnecessary fighting. That's why it's so important that we proactively -- (Both speaking): Co-create -- PV: A shared American culture that identifies and embraces the different values and norms within our diverse communities. WG: To be racially literate -- PV: To understand who we are so that we can heal together -- WG: We cannot neglect the heart -- PV: Or the mind. So, with our hundreds of stories, we decided to publish a racial literacy textbook to bridge that gap between our hearts and minds. WG: Our last book, ""The Classroom Index,"" shares deeply personal stories. PV: And pairs those personal stories to the brilliant research of statisticians and scholars. WG: Every day, we are still blown away by people's experiences, by the complexity of our collective racial reality. PV: So today, we ask you -- WG: Are you racially literate? Are you there yet? PV: Do you really understand the people around you, their stories, stories like these? It's not just knowing that Louise from Seattle survived Japanese American internment camps. It's knowing that, meanwhile, her husband was one of an estimated 33,000 Japanese Americans who fought for our country during the war, a country that was simultaneously interning their families. For most of us, those Japanese Americans both in camps and in service, now see their bravery, their resilience, their history forgotten. They've become only victims. PV: It's not just knowing that interracial marriages like Shermaine and Paul in DC exist, it's acknowledging that our society has been programmed for them to fail. That on their very first date someone shouted, ""Why are you with that black whore?"" That according to a Columbia study on cis straight relationships black is often equated with masculinity and Asian with femininity, leading more men to not value black women and to fetishize Asian women. Among black-white marriages in the year 2000, 73 percent had a black husband and a white wife. Paul and Shermaine defy that statistic. Black is beautiful, but it takes a lot to believe so once society says otherwise. WG: It's not just knowing that white people like Lisa in Chicago have white privilege, it's reflecting consciously on the term whiteness and its history, knowing that whiteness can't be equated with American. It's knowing that Lisa can't forget her own personal family's history of Jewish oppression. That she can't forget how, growing up, she was called a dirty Jew with horns and tails. But Lisa knows she can pass as white so she benefits from huge systemic and interpersonal privileges, and so she spends every day grappling with ways that she can leverage that white privilege for social justice. For example, starting conversations with other people of privilege about race. Or shifting the power in her classroom to her students by learning to listen to their experiences of racism and poverty. PV: It's not just knowing that native languages are dying. It's appreciating how fluency in the Cherokee language, which really only less than 12,000 people speak today, is an act of survival, of preservation of culture and history. It's knowing how the nongendered Cherokee language enabled Ahyoka's acceptance as a trans woman in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Her grandmother told her firmly a saying in Cherokee, ""I don't tell me who you are, you tell me who you are. And that is who you are."" WG: These are just parts of a few stories. There are approximately 323 million people in the United States. PV: And 7.4 billion people on the planet. WG: So we have a lot to listen to. PV: And a lot to learn. WG: We need to raise the bar. PV: Elevate our standards for racial literacy. Because without investing in an education that values -- WG: Both the stories -- PV: And statistics -- WG: The people -- PV: And the numbers -- WG: The interpersonal -- PV: And the systemic -- WG: There will always be a piece missing. PV: Today, so few of us understand each other. WG: We don't know how to communicate -- PV: Live together -- WG: Love one another. We need to all work together to create a new national community. PV: A new shared culture of mutual suffering and celebration. WG: We need to each begin by learning in our own local communities, bridging the gaps between our own hearts and minds to become racially literate. PV: Once we all do, we will be that much closer to living in spaces and systems that fight and care equally for all of us. WG: Then, none of us will be able to remain distant. PV: We couldn't -- sorry, mom and dad, college can wait. WG: We're on a gap year before college, traveling to all 50 states collecting stories for our next book. PV: And we still have 23 states left to interview in. (Both) Let's all get to work. Thank you. (Applause)"
6:13,Laura L. Dunn,It's time for the law to protect victims of gender violence,May 2018,"Throughout the United States, there is growing social awareness that sexual violence and harassment are far too common occurrences within our various institutions -- occurrences often without any accountability. As a result, the Me Too movement is upon us, and survivors everywhere are speaking out to demand change. Students have rallied against sexual assault on campus. Service members have demanded Congress reform the military, and workers ranging from Hollywood stars to janitorial staff have called out sexual harassment in the workplace. This is a tipping point. This is when a social movement can create lasting legal change. But only if we switch tactics. Instead of going institution by institution, fighting for reform, it's time to go to the Constitution. As it stands, the US Constitution denies fundamental protections to victims of gender violence such as sexual assault, intimate partner violence and stalking. Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits state governments from abusing its citizens, does not require state governments to intervene when private parties abuse its citizens. So what does that mean in real life? That means that when a woman calls the police from her home, afraid that an intruder may attack her, she is not entitled to the state's protection. Not only can the police fail to respond, but she will be left without any legal remedy if preventable harm occurs as a result. How can this be? It is because the state, theoretically, acts on behalf of all citizens collectively, not any one citizen individually. The resulting constitutional flaw directly contradicts international law, which requires nation-states to intervene and protect citizens against gender violence by private parties as a human right. Instead of requiring intervention, our Constitution leaves discretion -- discretion that states have used to discriminate systemically to deny countless victims any remedy. Unlike what you may have seen on ""Law &amp; Order: SVU,"" justice is rare for victims of gender violence. And even in those rare cases where law enforcement has chosen to act, victims have no rights during the resulting criminal process. You see, victims are not parties in a criminal case. Rather, they are witnesses; their bodies, evidence. The prosecution does not represent the interests of a victim. Rather, the prosecution represents the interests of the state. And the state has the discretion to dismiss criminal charges, enter lax plea deals and otherwise remove a victim's voice from the process, because again, a state theoretically represents the interests of all citizens collectively and not any one citizen individually. Despite this constitutional flaw, some victims of gender violence have found protections under federal Civil Rights statutes, such as Title IX. Title IX is not just about sports. Rather, it prohibits all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual violence and harassment within educational programs that accept federal funding. While initially targeting sex discrimination within admissions, Title IX has actually evolved over time to require educational institutions to intervene and address gender violence when committed by certain parties, such as when teachers, students or campus visitors commit sexual assault or harassment. So what this means is that through Title IX, those who seek access to education are protected against gender violence in a way that otherwise does not exist under the law. It is Title IX that requires educational institutions to take reports of gender violence seriously, or to suffer liability. And through campus-level proceedings, Title IX goes so far as to give victims equitable rights during the campus process, which means that victims can represent their own interests during proceedings, rather than relying on educational institutions to do so. And that's really important, because educational institutions have historically swept gender violence under the rug, much like our criminal justice system does today. So while Civil Rights protects some victims, we should want to protect all victims. Rather than going institution by institution, fighting for reform on campus, in the military, in the workplace, it's time to go to the Constitution and pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Originally proposed in 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment would guarantee gender equality under the law, and much like Title IX on campus, that constitutional amendment could require states to intervene and address gender violence as a prohibitive form of sex discrimination. While the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass in the 1970s, it actually came within three states of doing so. And within the last year, at least one of those states has ratified the amendment, because we live in different political times. From the Women's March to the Me Too movement, we have the growing political will of the people necessary to create lasting, legal change. So as a victims' rights attorney fighting to increase the prospect of justice for survivors across the country and as a survivor myself, I'm not here to say, ""Time's Up."" I'm here to say, ""It's time."" It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence. It's time to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, so that our legal system can become a system of justice, and #MeToo can finally become ""no more."" Thank you. (Applause)"
15:46,Diane Wolk-Rogers,A Parkland teacher's homework for us all,Apr 2018,"I teach history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On February 14, 2018, my school experienced one of the worst mass school shootings in American history. People want to know what we saw, what I felt. I don't remember everything, but I do remember I went into crisis mode, mother mode. There was no emotion. I lined up the kids, I held up a sign so they could follow me through the hall, just like a fire drill. I heard shots from one direction. Luckily, we were already moving in the opposite direction. We made it outside. We made it to safety. I called my mother. ""I'm OK."" I called my husband. ""I'm OK."" Then my daughter called, my voice cracked, and I knew I had to pull myself together. I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students. We sat there, only understanding that somehow, Valentine's Day -- We sat there, only understanding that somehow, Valentine's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do next. It's been two months, and every day I still hear the echoes of the ""pop, pop"" sound of the gunfire. I remember the fearful faces of my students when we knew it wasn't a drill. Still, there's no constant emotion, except for flashes of pain, grief and anger triggered by the news, or an insensitive comment, or just silence. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lost 17 precious lives on that horrible day. After, students asked us, the adults the hardest question: How can we stop the senseless violence? This was the most difficult question I've been asked. But it was not the first time I've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching in the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit what you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method to being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely to the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability. Admit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really thoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager to prove their smarts. And believe me, they know when I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, ""That's a great question. Let me research that and get back to you."" So when my students asked, ""How do we stop this senseless violence?"" I listened, and then I admitted, ""I don't know."" And like I always do when I don't know the answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start with the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since you've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" Meaning, the federal government could not infringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment was ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before the federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed as necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy marksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts, they founded the National Rifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment was written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was to ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced the gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation of the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment in our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate, regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson I'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here to stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact we don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people are killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer my students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is, how do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice questions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we hold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've actually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities sued gun manufacturers, saying they should make their products safer and do a better job of tracking where their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability for how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns and the owners who bought them were responsible should anything bad happen. In response to this and many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied for the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed with bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own and use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students and faculty die at my school, no one in this chain will assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we hold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated 300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility for gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers are willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get those 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners can take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been taking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence, the mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge our own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans will struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be rigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should seriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time and attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job of taking care of each other. Many social issues affect why people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs and psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers for people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access better mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism and poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts and emotions with words, not weapons. And the ""Washington Post"" reported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter and the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that multiple-choice questions almost never end with just three possibilities. There's always that fourth, Choice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe ""all of the above"" is too easy, and this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical thinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you to do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start, look to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible communication skills and a sense of citizenship that I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids engaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have to do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen, I'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization is to share your knowledge. This kind of honest, brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you needs to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge with each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)"
14:24,Robin Steinberg,What if we ended the injustice of bail?,Apr 2018,"I will never forget the first time I visited a client in jail. The heavy, metal door slammed behind me, and I heard the key turn in the lock. The cement floor underneath me had a sticky film on it that made a ripping sound, like tape being pulled off a box, every time I moved my foot. The only connection to the outside world was a small window placed too high to see. There was a small, square table bolted to the floor and two metal chairs, one on either side. That was the first time I understood viscerally -- just for a fleeting moment -- what incarceration might feel like. And I promised myself all those years ago as a young, public defender that I would never, ever forget that feeling. And I never have. It inspired me to fight for each and every one of my clients' freedom as if it was my own. Freedom. A concept so fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution. And yet, America is addicted to imprisonment. From slavery through mass incarceration, it always has been. Look, we all know the shocking numbers. The United States incarcerates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet. But what you may not know is that on any given night in America, almost half a million people go to sleep in those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything. These mothers and fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only: they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom. And that price is called bail. Now, bail was actually created as a form of conditional release. The theory was simple: set bail at an amount that somebody could afford to pay -- they would pay it -- it would give them an incentive to come back to court; it would give them some skin in the game. Bail was never intended to be used as punishment. Bail was never intended to hold people in jail cells. And bail was never, ever intended to create a two-tier system of justice: one for the rich and one for everybody else. But that is precisely what it has done. Seventy-five percent of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. People like Ramel. On a chilly October afternoon, Ramel was riding his bicycle in his South Bronx neighborhood on his way to a market to pick up a quart of milk. He was stopped by the police. And when he demanded to know why he was being stopped, an argument ensued, and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground in handcuffs, being charged with ""riding your bicycle on the sidewalk and resisting arrest."" He was taken to court, where a judge set 500 dollars bail. But Ramel -- he didn't have 500 dollars. So this 32-year-old father was sent to ""The Boat"" -- a floating jail barge that sits on the East River between a sewage plant and a fish market. That's right, you heard me. In New York City, in 2018, we have a floating prison barge that sits out there and houses primarily black and brown men who cannot pay their bail. Let's talk for a moment about what it means to be in jail even for a few days. Well, it can mean losing your job, losing your home, jeopardizing your immigration status. It may even mean losing custody of your children. A third of sexual victimization by jail staff happens in the first three days in jail, and almost half of all jail deaths, including suicides, happen in that first week. What's more, if you're held in jail on bail, you're four times more likely to get a jail sentence than if you had been free, and that jail sentence will be three times longer. And if you are black or Latino and cash bail has been set, you are two times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell than if you were white. Jail in America is a terrifying, dehumanizing and violent experience. Now imagine for just one moment that it's you stuck in that jail cell, and you don't have the 500 dollars to get out. And someone comes along and offers you a way out. ""Just plead guilty,"" they say. ""You can go home back to your job. Just plead guilty. You can kiss your kids goodnight tonight."" So you do what anybody would do in that situation. You plead guilty whether you did it or not. But now you have a criminal record that's going to follow you for the rest of your life. Jailing people because they don't have enough money to pay bail is one of the most unfair, immoral things we do as a society. But it is also expensive and counterproductive. American taxpayers -- they spend 14 billion dollars annually holding people in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything. That's 40 million dollars a day. What's perhaps more confounding is it doesn't make us any safer. Research is clear that holding somebody in jail makes you significantly more likely to commit a crime when you get out than if you had been free all along. Freedom makes all the difference. Low-income communities and communities of color have known that for generations. Together, they have pooled their resources to buy their loved ones freedom for as long as bondage and jail cells existed. But the reach of the criminal legal system has grown too enormous, and the numbers are just too large. Ninety-nine percent of jail growth in America has been the result -- over the last 20 years -- of pre-trial incarceration. I have been a public defender for over half my life, and I have stood by and watched thousands of clients as they were dragged into those jail cells because they didn't have enough money to pay bail. I have watched as questions of justice were subsumed by questions of money, calling into question the legitimacy of the entire American legal system. I am here to say something simple -- something obvious, but something urgent. Freedom makes all the difference, and freedom should be free. (Applause) But how are we going to make that happen? Well, that's the question I was wrestling with over a decade ago when I was sitting at a kitchen table with my husband, David, who is also a public defender. We were eating our Chinese takeout and venting about the injustice of it all when David looked up and said, ""Why don't we just start a bail fund, and just start bailing our clients out of jail?"" And in that unexpected moment, the idea for the Bronx Freedom Fund was born. Look, we didn't know what to expect. There were plenty of people that told us we were crazy and we were going to lose all of the money. People wouldn't come back because they didn't have any stake in it. But what if clients did come back? We knew that bail money comes back at the end of a criminal case, so it could come back into the fund, and we could use it over and over again for more and more bail. That was our big bet, and that bet paid off. Over the past 10 years, we have been paying bails for low-income residents of New York City, and what we have learned has exploded our ideas of why people come back to court and how the criminal legal system itself is operated. Turns out money isn't what makes people come back to court. We know this because when the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail, 96 percent of clients return for every court appearance, laying waste to the myth that it's money that mattered. It's powerful evidence that we don't need cash or ankle bracelets or unnecessary systems of surveillance and supervision. We simply need court reminders -- simple court reminders about when to come back to court. Next, we learned that if you're held in jail on a misdemeanor, 90 percent of people will plead guilty. But when the fund pays bail, over half the cases are dismissed. And in the entire history of the Bronx Freedom Fund, fewer than two percent of our clients have ever received a jail sentence of any kind. (Applause) Ramel, a week later -- he was still on the boat, locked in that jail cell. He was on the cusp of losing everything, and he was about to plead guilty, and the Bronx Freedom Fund intervened and paid his bail. Now, reunited with his daughter, he was able to fight his case from outside. Look, it took some time -- two years, to be exact -- but at the end of that, his case was dismissed in its entirety. For Ramel -- (Applause) For Ramel, the Bronx Freedom Fund was a lifeline, but for countless other Americans locked in jail cells, there is no freedom fund coming. It's time to do something about that. It's time to do something big. It's time to do something bold. It's time to do something, maybe, audacious? (Laughter) We want to take our proven, revolving bail-fund model that we built in the Bronx and spread it across America, attacking the front end of the legal system before incarceration begins. (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Here's the plan. (Applause) We're going to bail out as many people as we can as quickly as we can. Over the next five years, partnering with public defenders and local community organizations, we're going to set up 40 sites in high-need jurisdictions. The goal is to bail out 160,000 people. Our strategy leverages the fact that bail money comes back at the end of a case. Data from the Bronx shows that a dollar can be used two or three times a year, creating a massive force multiplier. So a dollar donated today can be used to pay bail for up to 15 people over the next five years. Our strategy also relies on the experience and the wisdom and the leadership of those who have experienced this injustice firsthand. (Applause) Each bail project site will be staffed by a team of bail disrupters. These are passionate, dedicated advocates from local communities, many of whom were formerly incarcerated themselves, who will pay bails and support clients while their cases are going through the legal system, providing them with whatever resources and support they may need. Our first two sites are up and running. One in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and one in St. Louis, Missouri. And Ramel? He's training right now to be a bail disrupter in Queens County, New York. (Applause) Our next three sites are ready to launch in Dallas, Detroit and Louisville, Kentucky. The Bail Project will attack the money bail system on an unprecedented scale. We will also listen, collect and elevate and honor the stories of our clients so that we can change hearts and minds, and we will collect critical, national data that we need so we can chart a better path forward so that we do not recreate this system of oppression in just another form. The Bail Project, by bailing out 160,000 people over the next five years, will become one of the largest non-governmental decarcerations of Americans in history. So look -- (Applause) the criminal legal system, as it exists -- it needs to be dismantled. But here's the thing I know from decades in the system: real, systemic change takes time, and it takes a variety of strategies. So it's going to take all of us. It's going to take the civil rights litigators, the community organizers, the academics, the media, the philanthropists, the students, the singers, the poets, and, of course, the voices and efforts of those who are impacted by this system. But here's what I also know: together, I believe we can end mass incarceration. But one last thing: those people, sitting in America, in those jail cells, in every corner of the country, who are held in jail on bail bondage, right now -- they need a lifeline today. That's where The Bail Project comes in. We have a proven model, a plan of action, and a growing network of bail disrupters who are audacious enough to dream big and fight hard, one bail at a time, for as long it takes, until true freedom and equal justice are a reality in America. Thank you. (Applause)"
13:43,Drew Philp,My $500 house in Detroit — and the neighbors who helped me rebuild it,Apr 2018,"In 2009, I bought a house in Detroit for 500 dollars. It had no windows, no plumbing, no electricity and it was filled with trash. The first floor held nearly 10,000 pounds of garbage, and that included the better part of a Dodge Caravan, cut into chunks with a reciprocating saw. (Laughter) I lived nearly two years without heat, woke up out of a dead sleep multiple times to gunshots, was attacked by a pack of wild dogs and ripped my kitchen cabinets from an abandoned school as they were actively tearing that school down. This, of course, is the Detroit that your hear about. Make no mistake, it's real. But there's another Detroit, too. Another Detroit that's more hopeful, more innovative, and may just provide some of the answers to cities struggling to reinvent themselves everywhere. These answers, however, do not necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom about good development. I think Detroit's real strength boils down to two words: radical neighborliness. And I wasn't able to see it myself until I lived there. About a decade ago, I moved to Detroit with no friends, no job and no money, at a time when it seemed like everyone else was moving out. Between 2000 and 2010, 25 percent of the city's population left. This included about half of the elementary-aged children. This was after six decades of decline. A city built for almost two million was down to less than 800,000. What you usually don't hear is that people didn't go very far. The population of the Detroit metro area itself has largely remained steady since the '70s. Most people who left Detroit just went to the suburbs, while the 139 square miles of the city deteriorated, leaving some estimates as high as 40 square miles of abandoned land -- about the size of San Francisco. Aside from platitudes such as the vague and agentless ""deindustrialization,"" Detroit's exodus can be summed up with two structures: freeways and walls. The freeways, coupled with massive governmental subsidies for the suburbs via infrastructure and home loans, allowed people to leave the city at will, taking with it tax base, jobs and education dollars. The walls made sure only certain people could leave. In multiple places, brick and concrete walls separate city and suburbs, white and black, running directly across municipal streets and through neighborhoods. They're mere physical manifestations of racist housing practices such as redlining, [Denying services to people of color] restrictive covenants and outright terror. In 1971, the Ku Klux Klan bombed 10 school buses rather than have them transport integrated students. All these have made Detroit the most racially segregated metro area in the United States. I grew up in a small town in Michigan, the son of a relatively blue-collar family. And after university, I wanted to do something -- probably naïvely -- to help. I didn't want to be one of the almost 50 percent of college graduates leaving the state at the time, and I thought I might use my fancy college education at home for something positive. I'd been reading this great American philosopher named Grace Lee Boggs who happened to live in Detroit, and she said something I can't forget. ""The most radical thing that I ever did was to stay put."" I thought buying a house might indelibly tie me to the city while acting as a physical protest to these walls and freeways. Because grants and loans weren't available to everyone, I decided I was going to do this without them and that I would wage my personal fight against the city that had loomed over my childhood with power tools. I eventually found an abandoned house in a neighborhood called Poletown. It looked like the apocalypse had descended. The neighborhood was prairie land. A huge, open expanse of waist-high grass cluttered only by a handful of crippled, abandoned structures and a few brave holdouts with well-kept homes. Just a 15-minute bike ride from the baseball stadium downtown, the neighborhood was positively rural. What houses were left looked like cardboard boxes left in the rain; two-story monstrosities with wide-open shells and melted porches. One of the most striking things I remember were the rosebushes, forgotten and running wild over tumbled-down fences, no longer cared for by anyone. This was my house on the day I boarded it up to protect it from the elements and further decay. I eventually purchased it from the county in a live auction. I'd assumed the neighborhood was dead. That I was some kind of pioneer. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. I was in no way a pioneer, and would come to understand how offensive that is. One of the first things I learned was to add my voice to the chorus, not overwrite what was already happening. (Voice breaking) Because the neighborhood hadn't died. It had just transformed in a way that was difficult to see if you didn't live there. Poletown was home to an incredibly resourceful, incredibly intelligent and incredibly resilient community. It was there I first experienced the power of radical neighborliness. During the year I worked on my house before moving in, I lived in a microcommunity inside Poletown, founded by a wild and virtuous farmer named Paul Weertz. Paul was a teacher in a Detroit public school for pregnant and parenting mothers, and his idea was to teach the young women to raise their children by first raising plants and animals. While the national average graduation rate for pregnant teens is about 40 percent, at Catherine Ferguson Academy it was often above 90, in part due to Paul's ingenuity. Paul brought much of this innovation to his block in Poletown, which he'd stewarded for more than 30 years, purchasing houses when they were abandoned, convincing his friends to move in and neighbors to stay and helping those who wanted to buy their own and fix them up. In a neighborhood where many blocks now only hold one or two houses, all the homes on Paul's block stand. It's an incredible testament to the power of community, to staying in one place and to taking ownership of one's own surroundings -- of simply doing it yourself. It's the kind of place where black doctors live next to white hipsters next to immigrant mothers from Hungary or talented writers from the jungles of Belize, showing me Detroit wasn't just black and white, and diversity could flourish when it's encouraged. Each year, neighbors assemble to bale hay for the farm animals on the block, teaching me just how much a small group of people can get done when they work together, and the magnetism of fantastical yet practical ideas. Radical neighborliness is every house behind Paul's block burning down, and instead of letting it fill up with trash and despair, Paul and the surrounding community creating a giant circular garden ringed with dozens of fruit trees, beehives and garden plots for anyone that wants one, helping me see that our challenges can often be assets. It's where residents are experimenting with renewable energy and urban farming and offering their skills and discoveries to others, illustrating we don't necessarily have to beg the government to provide solutions. We can start ourselves. It's where, for months, one of my neighbors left her front door unlocked in one of the most violent and dangerous cities in America so I could have a shower whenever I needed to go to work, as I didn't yet have one. It was when it came time to raise the beam on my own house that holds the structure aloft -- a beam that I cut out of an abandoned recycling factory down the street when not a single wall was left standing -- a dozen residents of Poletown showed up to help lift it, Amish style. Radical neighborliness is a zygote that grows into a worldview that ends up in homes and communities rebuilt in ways that respect humanity and the environment. It's realizing we have the power to create the world anew together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse. This is the Detroit that you don't hear much about. The Detroit between the ruin porn on one hand and the hipster coffee shops and billionaires saving the city on the other. There's a third way to rebuild, and it declines to make the same mistakes of the past. While building my house, I found something I didn't know I was looking for -- what a lot of millennials and people who are moving back to cities are looking for. Radical neighborliness is just another word for true community, the kind bound by memory and history, mutual trust and familiarity built over years and irreplaceable. And now, as you may have heard, Detroit is having a renaissance and pulling itself up from the ashes of despair, and the children and grandchildren of those who fled are returning, which is true. What isn't true is that this renaissance is reaching most Detroiters, or even more than a small fraction of them that don't live in the central areas of the city. These are the kind of people that have been in Detroit for generations and are mostly black. In 2016 alone, just last year, (Voice breaking) one in six houses in Detroit had their water shut off. Excuse me. The United Nations has called this a violation of human rights. And since 2005, one in three houses -- think about this, please -- one in every three houses has been foreclosed in the city, representing a population about the size of Buffalo, New York. (Sniffles) One in three houses foreclosed is not a crisis of personal responsibility; it is systemic. Many Detroiters, myself included, are worried segregation is now returning to the city itself on the coattails of this renaissance. Ten years ago, it was not possible to go anywhere in Detroit and be in a crowd completely made of white people. Now, troublingly, that is possible. This is the price that we're paying for conventional economic resurgence. We're creating two Detroits, two classes of citizens, cracking the community apart. For all the money and subsidies, for all the streetlights installed, the dollars for new stadiums and slick advertisements and positive buzz, we're shutting off water to tens of thousands of people living right on the Great Lakes, the world's largest source of it. Separate has always meant unequal. This is a grave mistake for all of us. When economic development comes at the cost of community, it's not just those who have lost their homes or access to water who are harmed, but it breaks little pieces of our own humanity as well. None of us can truly be free, none of us can truly be comfortable, until our neighbors are, too. For those of us coming in, it means we must make sure we aren't inadvertently contributing to the destruction of community again, and to follow the lead of those who have been working on these problems for years. In Detroit, that means average citizens deputizing themselves to create water stations and deliveries for those who have lost access to it. Or clergy and teachers engaging in civil disobedience to block water shutoff trucks. It's organizations buying back foreclosed homes for their inhabitants or fighting misinformation on forced sales through social media and volunteer-run hotlines. For me, it means helping others to raise the beams on their own formerly abandoned houses, or helping to educate those with privilege, now increasingly moving into cities, how we might come in and support rather than stress existing communities. It's chipping in when a small group of neighbors decides to buy back a foreclosed home and return the deeds to the occupants. And for you, for all of us, it means finding a role to play in our own communities. It means living your life as a reflection of the world that you want to live in. It means trusting those who know the problems best -- the people who live them -- with solutions. I know a third way is possible because I have lived it. I live it right now in a neighborhood called Poletown in one of the most maligned cities in the world. If we can do it in Detroit, you can do it wherever you're from, too. What I've learned over the last decade, building my house, wasn't so much about wiring or plumbing or carpentry -- although I did learn these things -- is that true change, real change, starts first with community, with a radical sense of what it means to be a neighbor. It turned at least one abandoned house into a home. Thank you. (Applause)"
20:18,Christian Picciolini,My descent into America's neo-Nazi movement — and how I got out,Apr 2018,"My journey away from violent extremism began 22 years ago, when I denounced racism and left the American white supremacist skinhead movement that I had helped build. (Cheers and applause) I was just 22 years old at the time, but I had already spent eight years, from the time I was 14 years old, as one of the earliest and youngest members and an eventual leader within America's most violent hate movement. But I wasn't born into hate; in fact, it was quite the opposite. I had a relatively normal childhood. My parents are Italian immigrants who came to the United States in the mid-1960s and settled on the South Side of Chicago, where they eventually met, and opened a small beauty shop. Right after I was born, things got a little bit more difficult. They struggled to survive with raising a young family and a new business, often working seven days a week, 14 hours a day, taking on second and third jobs just to earn a meager living. And quality time with my parents was pretty nonexistent. Even though I knew they loved me very much, growing up, I felt abandoned. I was lonely, and I started to withdraw, and then I started to resent my parents and become very angry. And as I was growing up, through my teenage years, I started to act out to try and get attention from my parents. And one day, when I was 14, I was standing in an alley, and I was smoking a joint, and a man who was twice my age, with a shaved head and tall black boots, came up to me, and he snatched the joint from my lips. Then he put his hand on my shoulder and he looked me in the eyes, and he said, ""That's what the communists and the Jews want you to do to keep you docile."" I was 14 years old, I'd been trading baseball cards and watching ""Happy Days"" -- I didn't really know what a Jew was. (Laughter) It's true. And the only communist that I knew was the bad Russian guy in my favorite Rocky movie. (Laughter) And since I'm here baring my soul with you, I can reveal that I did not even know what the word ""docile"" meant. (Laughter) Dead serious. But it was as if this man in this alley had offered me a lifeline. For 14 years, I'd felt marginalized and bullied. I had low self-esteem. And frankly, I didn't know who I was, where I belonged, or what my purpose was. I was lost. And overnight, because this man had pulled me in, and I had grabbed onto that lifeline with every fiber of my being, I had gone from ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" to full-blown Nazi. Overnight. I started to listen to the rhetoric and believe it. I started to watch very closely as the leaders of this organization would target vulnerable young people who felt marginalized and then draw them in with promises of paradise that were broken. And then I started to recruit myself. I started to do that by making white-power music. And soon, I became the leader of that infamous organization that was led by that man in that alley who recruited me that day, who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead and who had radicalized me. For the next eight years, I believed the lies that I had been fed. And though I saw no evidence of it whatsoever, I didn't hesitate to blame every Jewish person in the world for what I thought was a white, European genocide being promoted by them through a multiculturalist agenda. I blamed people of color for the crime and violence and the drugs in the city, completely neglecting the fact that I was committing acts of violence on a daily basis, and that in many cases, it was white supremacists who were funneling drugs into the inner cities. And I blamed immigrants for taking jobs from white Americans, completely neglecting the fact that my parents were hardworking immigrants who struggled to survive, despite not getting help from anybody else. For the next eight years, I saw friends die, I saw others go to prison and inflict untold pain on countless victims and their families' lives. I heard horrific stories from young women in the movement, who'd been brutally raped by the very men they were conditioned to trust, and I myself committed acts of violence against people, solely for the color of their skin, who they loved, or the god that they prayed to. I stockpiled weapons for what I thought was an upcoming race war. I went to six high schools; I was kicked out of four of them, one of them, twice. And 25 years ago, I wrote and performed racist music that found its way to the internet decades later and partially inspired a young white nationalist to walk into a sacred Charleston, South Carolina, church and senselessly massacre nine innocent people. But then my life changed. At 19 years old, I met a girl who was not in the movement, who didn't have a racist bone in her body, and I fell in love with her. And at 19, we got married, and we had our first son. And when I held my son in my arms in the delivery room that day, not only did I reconnect with some of the innocence that I had lost at 14 years old, but it also began to challenge the very important things that drew me to the movement to begin with: identity, community and purpose -- things that I had been struggling with as a young boy. And now, I struggled with the concept of who I was again. Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger, or was I a caring father and husband? Was my community the one that I had manufactured around me to boost my own ego, because I felt self-hatred for myself and I wanted to project it onto others, or was it the one that I had physically given life to? Was my purpose to scorch the earth or was it to make it a better place for my family? And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me, I became very confused with who I'd been for the last eight years. And if only I'd been brave enough to walk away at that moment, to understand what the struggle was that was happening inside of me, then maybe tragedy could have been averted. Instead, I did compromise. I took myself off the streets for the benefit of my family, because I was nervous that maybe I could go to jail or end up dead, and they would have to fend for themselves. So I stepped back as a leader, and instead I opened a record store that I was going to sell white-power music in, of course, because I was importing it in from Europe. But I knew that if I was just a racist store selling racist music the community would not allow me to be there. So I decided I was going to also stock the shelves with other music, like punk rock and heavy metal and hip-hop. And while the white-power music that I was selling was 75 percent of my gross revenue, because people were driving in from all over the country to buy it from the only store that was selling it, I also had customers come in to buy the other music. And eventually, they started to talk to me. One day, a young black teen came in, and he was visibly upset. And I decided to ask him what was wrong. And he told me that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And suddenly, this young black teenager, who I'd never had a meaningful conversation or interaction with, I was able to connect with, because my own mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and I could feel his pain. On another occasion, a gay couple came in with their son, and it was undeniable to me that they loved their son in the same profound ways that I loved mine. And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize or justify the prejudice that I had in my head. I decided to pull the white-power music from the inventory when I became too embarrassed to sell it in front of my new friends. And of course, the store couldn't sustain itself, so I had to close it. At that same time, I lost nearly everything in my life. I used it as an opportunity to walk away from the movement that I'd been a part of for eight years, the only identity, community and purpose that I'd really known for most of my life. So I had nobody. I lost my livelihood because I closed the store. I didn't have a great relationship with my parents, even though they tried. And my wife and children left me, because I hadn't left the movement and disengaged quickly enough. And suddenly, I didn't know who I was again, or where I fit in or what my purpose was supposed to be. I was miserable inside, and I often woke up in the morning wishing that I hadn't. About five years in, one of the few friends that I had was concerned about my well-being, and she came to me and she said, ""You need to do something, because I don't want to see you die."" And she suggested that I go apply for a job where she worked, at a company called IBM. Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too. (Laughter) Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi covered in hate tattoos. I didn't go to college. I'd been kicked out of multiple high schools multiple times. I didn't even own a computer. But I went in, and somehow, miraculously, I got the job. I was thrilled. And then I became terrified to learn that they'd actually be putting me back at my old high school, the same one I got kicked out of twice, to install their computers. This was a high school where I had committed acts of violence against students, against faculty; where I had protested out in front of the school for equal rights for whites and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria to try and demand a white student union. And of course, as karma would have it, within the first couple of hours, who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes, the tough black security guard I had gotten in a fistfight with, that got me kicked out the second time and led out in handcuffs from the school. He didn't recognize me, but I saw him, and I didn't know what to do. I was frozen; I was this grown man now, years out of the movement, and I was sweating and I was trembling. But I decided I had to do something. And I decided I needed to suffer under the weight of my past, because for five years I had tried to outrun it. I'd tried to make new friends and cover my tattoos with long sleeves, and I wouldn't admit it because I was afraid of being judged the same way I had judged other people. Well, I decided I was going to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -- probably not the smartest decision that I made. (Laughter) But when I found him, he was getting into his car, and I tapped him on the shoulder. And when he turned around and he recognized me, he took a step back because he was afraid. And I didn't know what to say. Finally, the words came out of my mouth, and all I could think to say was, ""I'm sorry."" And he embraced me, and he forgave me. And he encouraged me to forgive myself. He recognized that it wasn't the story of some broken go-nowhere kid who was going to just join a gang and go to prison. He knew that this was the story of every young person who was vulnerable, who was searching for identity, community and purpose, and then hit a wall and was unable to find it and went down a dark path. And he made me promise one thing, that I would tell my story to whoever would listen. That was 18 years ago, and I've been doing it ever since. (Applause) You might be asking yourself right now: How does a good kid from a hardworking immigrant family end up going down such a dark path? One word: potholes. That's right. Potholes. I had a lot of potholes when I was kid. We all had them -- you know, the things in life that we hit that invariably just kind of nudge us off our path, and if they remain unresolved or untreated or not dealt with, sometimes we can get dangerously lost down pretty dark corridors. Potholes can be things like trauma, abuse, unemployment, neglect, untreated mental health conditions, even privilege. And if we hit enough potholes on our journey in life, and we don't have the resources or the help to navigate around them or to pull us out, well, sometimes good people end up doing bad things. One such person who had potholes is Darrell. Darrell is from upstate New York. He had read my memoir, and he was really upset about the ending. You see, I'd gotten out of the movement and he was still in. And he emailed me and he said, ""I didn't really like the way that turned out."" And I said, ""Well, I'm sorry."" (Laughter) ""But if you want to talk about it, we could certainly do that."" And after a couple of weeks of going back and forth with Darrell, I learned he was a 31-year-old military veteran who had been injured and was really angry about not being able to go to Afghanistan to kill Muslims. And one day on the phone, he told me that he had seen a Muslim man in the park praying, and that all he wanted to do was kick him in the face. I flew to Buffalo the next day, and I sat down with Darrell, and I asked him, ""Have you ever met a Muslim person before?"" And he said, ""No! Why the hell would I want to do that? They're evil. I don't want anything to do with them."" I said, ""OK."" So I excused myself, and I went into the bathroom and I took my phone out in the bathroom, and I Googled the local mosque, and I called them very quietly from the bathroom, and I said, ""Excuse me, imam, I need a favor. I have a Christian man who would really love to learn more about your religion."" (Laughter) ""Do you mind if we stop by?"" Well, it took some convincing for Darrell to go, but finally we got there, and when I knocked on the door, the imam said he only had 15 minutes left for us, because he was preparing for a prayer service. I said, ""We'll take it."" We went in, and two and a half hours later, we came out after hugging and crying and, very strangely, bonding over Chuck Norris for some reason. (Laughter) I don't know what it was about that, but that's what happened. And I'm happy to say now that Darrell and the imam, you can often find them at the local falafel stand, having lunch together. (Applause) You see, it's our disconnection from each other. Hatred is born of ignorance. Fear is its father, and isolation is its mother. When we don't understand something, we tend to be afraid of it, and if we keep ourselves from it, that fear grows, and sometimes, it turns into hatred. Since I've left the movement, I've helped over a hundred people disengage from extremist movements, from white supremacist groups -- (Applause) to even jihadist groups. And the way I do that is not by arguing with them, not by debating them, not by even telling them they're wrong, even though, boy, I want to sometimes. I don't do that. Instead, I don't push them away. I draw them in closer, and I listen very closely for their potholes, and then I begin to fill them in. I try to make people more resilient, more self-confident, more able to have skills to compete in the marketplace so that they don't have to blame the other, the other that they've never met. I'd like to just leave you with one last thing before I go. Of all the people I've worked with, they will all tell you the same thing. One, they became extremists because they wanted to belong, not because of ideology or dogma. And second, what brought them out was receiving compassion from the people they least deserved it from, when they least deserved it. (Applause) So I would like to leave you with a challenge: go out there today, tomorrow -- hopefully every day -- find somebody that you think is undeserving of your compassion and give it to them, because I guarantee you, they're the ones who need it the most. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
9:44,Erica Stone,Academic research is publicly funded — why isn't it publicly available?,Mar 2018,"Do you ever find yourself referencing a study in conversation that you didn't actually read? (Laughter) I was having coffee with a friend of mine the other day, and I said, ""You know, I read a new study that says coffee reduces the risk of depression in women."" But really, what I read was a tweet. (Laughter) That said -- (Laughter) ""A new study says drinking coffee may decrease depression risk in women."" (Laughter) And that tweet had a link to the ""New York Times"" blog, where a guest blogger translated the study findings from a ""Live Science"" article, which got its original information from the Harvard School of Public Health news site, which cited the actual study abstract, which summarized the actual study published in an academic journal. (Laughter) It's like the six degrees of separation, but with research. (Laughter) So, when I said I read a study, what I actually read was 59 characters that summarized 10 years of research. (Laughter) So, when I said I read a study, I was reading fractions of the study that were put together by four different writers that were not the author, before it got to me. That doesn't seem right. But accessing original research is difficult, because academics aren't regularly engaging with popular media. And you might be asking yourself, why aren't academics engaging with popular media? It seems like they'd be a more legitimate source of information than the media pundits. Right? (Laughter) In a country with over 4,100 colleges and universities, it feels like this should be the norm. But it's not. So, how did we get here? To understand why scholars aren't engaging with popular media, you first have to understand how universities work. Now, in the last six years, I've taught at seven different colleges and universities in four different states. I'm a bit of an adjunct extraordinaire. (Laughter) And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD. In all of these different institutions, the research and publication process works the same way. First, scholars produce research in their fields. To fund their research, they apply for public and private grants and after the research is finished, they write a paper about their findings. Then they submit that paper to relevant academic journals. Then it goes through a process called peer review, which essentially means that other experts are checking it for accuracy and credibility. And then, once it's published, for-profit companies resell that information back to universities and public libraries through journal and database subscriptions. So, that's the system. Research, write, peer-review, publish, repeat. My friends and I call it feeding the monster. And you can see how this might create some problems. The first problem is that most academic research is publicly funded but privately distributed. Every year, the federal government spends 60 billion dollars on research. According to the National Science Foundation, 29 percent of that goes to public research universities. So, if you're quick at math, that's 17.4 billion dollars. Tax dollars. And just five corporations are responsible for distributing most publicly funded research. In 2014, just one of those companies made 1.5 billion dollars in profit. It's a big business. And I bet you can see the irony here. If the public is funding academics' research, but then we have to pay again to access the results, it's like we're paying for it twice. And the other major problem is that most academics don't have a whole lot of incentive to publish outside of these prestigious subscription-based journals. Universities build their tenure and promotion systems around the number of times scholars publish. So, books and journal articles are kind of like a form of currency for scholars. Publishing articles helps you get tenure and more research grants down the road. But academics are not rewarded for publishing with popular media. So, this is the status quo. The current academic ecosystem. But I don't think it has to be this way. We can make some simple changes to flip the script. So, first, let's start by discussing access. Universities can begin to challenge the status quo by rewarding scholars for publishing not just in these subscription-based journals but in open-access journals as well as on popular media. Now, the open-access movement is starting to make some progress in many disciplines, and fortunately, some other big players have started to notice. Google Scholar has made open-access research searchable and easier to find. Congress, last year, introduced a bill that suggests that academic research projects with over 100 million or more in funding should develop an open-access policy. And this year, NASA opened up its entire research library to the public. So, you can see this idea is beginning to catch on. But access isn't just about being able to get your hands on a document or a study. It's also about making sure that that document or study is easily understood. So, let's talk about translation. I don't envision this translation to look like the six degrees of separation that I illustrated earlier. Instead, what if scholars were able to take the research that they're doing and translate it on popular media and be able to engage with the public? If scholars did this, the degrees of separation between the public and research would shrink by a lot. So, you see, I'm not suggesting a dumbing-down of the research. I'm just suggesting that we give the public access to that research and that we shift the venue and focus on using plain language so that the public who's paying for the research can also consume it. And there are some other benefits to this approach. By showing the public how their tax dollars are being used to fund research, they can begin to redefine universities' identities so that universities' identities are not just based on a football team or the degrees they grant but on the research that's being produced there. And when there's a healthy relationship between the public and scholars, it encourages public participation in research. Can you imagine what that might look like? What if social scientists helped local police redesign their sensitivity trainings and then collaboratively wrote a manual to model future trainings? Or what if our education professors consulted with our local public schools to decide how we're going to intervene with our at-risk students and then wrote about it in a local newspaper? Because a functioning democracy requires that the public be well-educated and well-informed. Instead of research happening behind paywalls and bureaucracy, wouldn't it be better if it was unfolding right in front of us? Now, as a PhD student, I realize I'm critiquing the club I want to join. (Laughter) Which is a dangerous thing to do, since I'm going to be on the academic job market in a couple of years. But if the status quo in academic research is to publish in the echo chambers of for-profit journals that never reach the public, you better believe my answer is going to be ""nope."" I believe in inclusive, democratic research that works in the community and talks with the public. I want to work in research and in an academic culture where the public is not only seen as a valuable audience, but a constituent, a participant. And in some cases even the expert. And this isn't just about giving you guys access to information. It's about shifting academic culture from publishing to practice and from talking to doing. And you should know that this idea, this hope -- it doesn't just belong to me. I'm standing on the shoulders of many scholars, teachers, librarians and community members who also advocate for including more people in the conversation. I hope you join our conversation, too. Thank you. (Applause)"
17:55,Isabel Wilkerson,The Great Migration and the power of a single decision,Mar 2018,"Imagine with me this scene. It's a scene that played out in nearly all of our families. It's a scene in which a young person, somewhere in our family tree, somewhere in our lineage had a heartbreaking decision to make. It was a decision to leave all that they had known. And all of the people that they had loved and to set out for a place far, far away that they had never seen in hopes that life might be better. Migration is usually a young person's endeavor. It's the kind of thing that you do when you're on the cusp of life. And so, there is, in all of our families, this young person somewhere in our background. That person is standing at a dock, about to board a ship that will cross the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean. That person is loading up a truck that will cross the Rio Grande. Or that person is standing at a railroad platform about to board a train that will cross rivers and mountains out of the Jim Crow South to what they hope will be freedom in the North. And there, with this young person as they are about to board that ship, that boat, that truck, that train, are the people who raised them. Their mother, their father, their aunt, their uncle, their grandparents, whoever it might have been who had gotten them to this point. Those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them. And as they looked into the eyes of the people who had raised them, there was no guarantee that they would ever see them alive again. Remember, there was no Skype, no e-mail, no cell phones not even reliable long-distance telephone service. And even if there had been, many of the people that they were leaving did not even have telephones. This was going to be a complete break from all that they knew and all of the people that they loved. And the very next time that they might hear anything about the people who had raised them might be a telegram saying, ""Your father has passed away."" Or, ""Your mother is very, very ill. You must return home quickly if you are to see her alive again."" That is the magnitude of the sacrifice that had to have happened in nearly all of our families just for us to be here. A single decision that changed the course of families and lineages and countries and history to the current day. One of these migration streams stands out in ways that we may not realize. It was called the Great Migration. It was the outpouring of six million African Americans from the Jim Crow South to the cities of the North and West, from the time of World War I until the 1970s. It stands out because this was the first time in American history that American citizens had to flee the land of their birth just to be recognized as the citizens that they had always been. No other group of Americans has had to act like immigrants in order to be recognized as citizens. So this great migration was not a move. It was actually a seeking of political asylum within the borders of one's own country. They were defecting a caste system known as Jim Crow. It was an artificial hierarchy in which everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like. This caste system was so arcane that it was actually against the law for a black person and a white person to merely play checkers together in Birmingham. You could go to jail if you were caught playing checkers with a person of a different race. Someone must have seen a black person and a white person playing checkers with someone in some town square. And maybe the wrong person was winning or they were having too good of a time, but whatever it was that this person saw, with this black person and this white person playing checkers, they felt the entire foundation of Southern civilization was in peril. And decided that it was worth taking the time to write this down as a law. This caste system was so arcane that in courtrooms throughout the South there was actually a black Bible and an altogether separate white Bible to swear to tell the truth on in court. The very word of God was segregated in the caste system of the Jim Crow South. The same sacred object could not be touched by hands of different races. This artificial hierarchy, because it goes against human desires to be free, required a tremendous amount of violence to maintain. Such that every four days, somewhere in the American South, every four days an African American was lynched for some perceived breach of protocol in this caste system in the decades leading up to the start of the Great Migration. This caste system had been put in place for many, many reasons. But one of them was to maintain the economic order of the South, which required not just a supply of cheap labor but an oversupply of cheap labor to work at the will of the land. This Great Migration began when the North had a labor problem. The North had a labor problem because it had been relying on cheap labor from Europe -- immigrants from Europe -- to work the factories and the foundries and the steel mills. But during World War I, migration from Europe came to a virtual halt. And so the North had a labor problem. And so the North decided to go and find the cheapest labor in the land which meant African Americans in the South, many of whom were not even being paid for their hard work. Many of them were working for the right to live on the land that they were farming. They were sharecroppers and not even being paid. So they were ripe for recruitment. But it turned out that the South did not take kindly to this poaching of its cheap labor. The South actually did everything it could to keep the people from leaving. They would arrest people from the railroad platforms. Remember, putatively free American citizens. They would arrest them from their train seats. And when there were too many people to arrest, they would wave the train on through so that people who had been hoping and saving and praying for the chance to get to freedom had to figure out: How now will we get out? And as they made their way out of the South, away from Jim Crow, they followed three beautifully predictable streams as is the case in any migration throughout human history. In this particular case, there were three streams. One was the migration along the East Coast from Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia to Washington DC, to Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York and on up the East coast. There was the Midwest stream, which carried people from Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas to Chicago, to Detroit, to Cleveland and the entire Midwest. And then there was the West Coast stream, which carried people from Louisiana and Texas out to California. And when they really wanted to get away, they went to Seattle. And when they really, really wanted to get away, they went to Alaska, the farthest possible point within the borders of the United States from Jim Crow South. Before the Great Migration began, 90 percent of all African Americans were living in the South. Nearly held captive in the South. But by the time this Great Migration was over, nearly half were living all over the rest of the country. So this ended up being nearly a complete redistribution of part of an entire people. This Great Migration was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people signaled that they had options and were willing to take them. That had not happened in the three centuries in which African Americans had been on that soil at that time. It had not happened in 12 generations of enslavement that preceded nearly a century of Jim Crow. How many ""greats"" do you have to add to the word ""grandparent"" to begin to imagine how long enslavement lasted in the United States? Secondly, this Great Migration was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people actually had a chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their God-given talents and where they would pursue them. Think about those cotton fields and those rice plantations and those tobacco fields and those sugar plantations. On those sugar plantations, and on those tobacco fields, and on those rice plantations, and on those cotton fields were opera singers, jazz musicians, playwrights, novelists, surgeons, attorneys, accountants, professors, journalists. And how do we know that? We know that because that is what they and their children and now their grandchildren and even great-grandchildren have often chosen to become once they had the chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their God-given talents. Without the Great Migration, there might not have been a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be. Her parents were from Alabama and from Georgia. They migrated to Ohio, where their daughter would get to do something that we all take for granted at this point, but which was against the law and against protocol for African Americans at the time that she would have been growing up in the South, had they stayed. And that is just to walk into a library and take out a library book. Merely by making the single decision to leave, her parents assured that their daughter would get access to books. And if you're going to become a Nobel laureate, it helps to get a book now and then. You know, it helps. Music as we know it was reshaped by the Great Migration. As they came North, they brought with them, on their hearts and in their memories, the music that had sustained the ancestors -- the blues music, the spirituals and the gospel music that had sustained them through the generations. And they converted this music into whole new genres of music. And got the chance to record this music, this new music that they were creating, and to spread it throughout the world. Without the Great Migration, ""Motown"" would not have existed. The founder, Berry Gordy, his parents were from Georgia. They migrated to Detroit. And when he got to be a grown man, he decided he wanted to go into music. But he didn't have the wherewithal to go all over the country looking for the best talent, and it turned out he didn't have to. It turned out that there he was, surrounded by children of the Great Migration whose parents had brought this music up with them during the journey. And among those children were these three girls, there was Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard and there was a third one: Diana Ross. We might not know Diana Ross' name had there been no Great Migration. Because like a lot of Americans and a lot of human beings in general, she might not have existed because her parents might not have met. Her mother was from Alabama, father from West Virginia, they migrated to Detroit, different years, met, married, had her and her siblings, and thus a legend was born. Jazz was a creation of the Great Migration. And one of the greatest gifts of the Great Migration. Starting with Louis Armstrong, who was born in Louisiana and migrated on the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago, where he got the chance to build on the talent that was within him all along. Miles Davis. His parents were from Arkansas. They migrated to southern Illinois, where he would get the chance to build on the talents that were within him all along but which could have gone fallow in the cotton country of Arkansas. John Coltrane. He migrated at the age of 16 from North Carolina to Philadelphia, where, upon arrival in Philadelphia, he got his first alto sax. And there are lovers of jazz who cannot imagine a world without John Coltrane having gotten a hold of a saxophone. Thelonious Monk. Michael Jackson. Jesse Owens. Prince. August Wilson. Richard Wright. Ralph Ellison. Michelle Obama. These are all a few of the millions of people who were products of the single decision to migrate. The people of the Great Migration met with tremendous resistance in the North. And they were not able to defeat all social injustice. But one person added to another person, added to another person, multiplied by millions, were able to become the advance guard of the civil rights movement. One person added to another person, added to another person, multiplied by millions, acting on a single decision, were able to change the region that they had been forced to flee. They had more power in leaving than by staying. By their actions, these people who had absolutely nothing were able to do what a president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was not able to do. These people, by their actions, were able to do what the Emancipation Proclamation could not do. These people, by their actions, were able to do what the powers that be, North and South, could not or would not do. They freed themselves. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"
15:19,Deanna Van Buren,What a world without prisons could look like,Mar 2018,"A lot of people call me a ""justice architect."" But I don't design prisons. I don't design jails. I don't design detention centers, and I don't even design courthouses. All the same, I get a call every week, saying, ""OK, but you design better prisons, right? You know, like those pretty ones they're building in Europe."" And I always pause. And I invite them, and I invite you today, to imagine a world without prisons. What does that justice feel and look like? What do we need to build to get there? I'd like to show you some ideas today of things that we're building. And I'm going to start with an early prototype. This I built when I was five. I call it ""the healing hut."" And I built it after I got sent home from school for punching this kid in the face because he called me the N-word. OK, he deserved it. It happened a lot, though, because my family had desegregated a white community in rural Virginia. And I was really scared. I was afraid. I was angry. And so I would run into the forest, and I would build these little huts. They were made out of twigs and leaves and blankets I had taken from my mom. And as the light would stream into my refuge, I would feel at peace. Despite my efforts to comfort myself, I still left my community as soon as I could, and I went to architecture school and then into a professional career designing shopping centers, homes for the wealthy and office buildings, until I stepped into a prison for the first time. It was the Chester State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania. And my friend, she invited me there to work with some of her incarcerated students and teach them about the positive power of design. The irony is so obvious, right? As I approached this concrete building, these tiny little windows, barbed wire, high walls, observation towers, and on the inside, these cold, hard spaces, little light or air, the guards are screaming, the doors are clanking, there's a wall of cells filled with so many black and brown bodies. And I realized that what I was seeing was the end result of our racist policies that had caused mass incarceration. But as an architect, what I was seeing was how a prison is the worst building type we could have created to address the harm that we're doing to one another. I thought, ""Well, could I design an alternative to this, other than building a prettier prison?"" It didn't feel good to me; it still doesn't feel good. But back then, I just didn't know what to do. What do we build instead of this? And then I heard about restorative justice. I felt at peace again, because here was an alternative system that says when a crime is committed, it is a breach of relationship, that the needs of those who have been harmed must be addressed first; that those who have committed the offense have an obligation to make amends. And what they are are really intense dialogues, where all stakeholders come together to find a way to repair the breach. Early data shows that restorative justice builds empathy; that it reduces violent reoffending by up to 75 percent; that it eases PTSD in survivors of the most severe violence. And because of these reasons, we see prosecutors and judges and district attorneys starting to divert cases out of court and into restorative justice so that some people never touch the system altogether. And so I thought, ""Well, damn -- why aren't we designing for this system?"" (Applause) Instead of building prisons, we should be building spaces to amplify restorative justice. And so I started in schools, because suspensions and expulsions have been fueling the pathway to prison for decades. And many school districts -- probably some of your own -- are turning to restorative justice as an alternative. So, my first project -- I just turned this dirty little storage room into a peacemaking room for a program in a high school in my hometown of Oakland. And after we were done, the director said that the circles she was holding in this space were more powerful in bringing the community together after fighting at school and gun violence in the community, and that students and teachers started to come here just because they saw it as a space of refuge. So what was happening is that the space was amplifying the effects of the process. OK, then I did something that architects always do, y'all. I was like, I'm going to build something massive now, right? I'm going to build the world's first restorative justice center all by myself. And it's going to be a beautiful figure on the skyline, like a beacon in the night. Thousands of people will come here instead of going to court. I will single-handedly end mass incarceration and win lots of design awards. (Laughter) And then I checked myself -- (Laughter) because here's the deal: we are incarcerating more of our citizens per capita than any country in the world. And the fastest-growing population there are black women. Ninety-five percent of all these folks are coming home. And most of them are survivors of severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse. They have literally been on both sides of the harm. So I thought, uh, maybe I should ask them what we should build instead of prisons. So I returned with a restorative justice expert, and we started to run the country's first design studios with incarcerated men and women around the intersection of restorative justice and design. And it was transformative for me. I saw all these people behind walls in a totally different way. These were souls deeply committed to their personal transformation and being accountable. They were creative, they were visionary. Danny is one of those souls. He's been incarcerated at San Quentin for 27 years for taking a life at the age of 21. From the very beginning, he's been focused on being accountable for that act and doing his best to make amends from behind bars. He brought that work into a design for a community center for reconciliation and wellness. It was a beautiful design, right? So it's this green campus filled with these circular structures for victim and offender dialogue. And when he presented the project to me, he started crying. He said, ""After being in the brutality of San Quentin for so long, we don't think reconciliation will happen. This design is for a place that fulfills the promise of restorative justice. And it feels closer now."" I know for a fact that just the visualization of spaces for restorative justice and healing are transformative. I've seen it in our workshops over and over again. But I think we know that just visualizing these spaces is not enough. We have to build them. And so I started to look for justice innovators. They are not easy to find. But I found one. I found the Center for Court Innovation. They were bringing Native American peacemaking practices into a non-Native community for the very first time in the United States. And I approached them, and I said, ""OK, well, as you set up your process, could I work with the community to design a peacemaking center?"" And they said yes. Thank God, because I had no backup to these guys. And so, in the Near Westside of Syracuse, New York, we started to run design workshops with the community to both locate and reenvision an old drug house to be a peacemaking center. The Near Westside Peacemaking Project is complete. And they are already running over 80 circles a year, with a very interesting outcome, and that it is the space itself that's convincing people to engage in peacemaking for the very first time in their lives. Isabel and her daughter are some of those community members. And they had been referred to peacemaking to heal their relationship after a history of family abuse, sexual abuse and other issues that they'd been having in their own family and the community. And, you know, Isabel didn't want to do peacemaking. She was like, ""This is just like going to court. What is this peacemaking stuff?"" But when she showed up, she was stressed, she was anxious. But when she got in, she kind of looked around, and she settled in. And she turned to the coordinator and said, ""I feel comfortable here -- at ease. It's homey."" Isabel and her daughter made a decision that day to engage and complete the peacemaking process. And today, their relationship is transformed; they're doing really well and they're healing. So after this project, I didn't go into a thing where I'm going to make a huge peacemaking center. I did want to have peacemaking centers in every community. But then a new idea emerged. I was doing a workshop in Santa Rita Jail in California, and one of our incarcerated designers, Doug, said, ""Yeah, you know, repairing the harm, getting back on my feet, healing -- really important. But the reality is, Deanna, when I get home, I don't have anywhere to go. I have no job -- who's going to hire me? I'm just going to end up back here."" And you know what, he's right, because 60 to 75 percent of those returning to their communities will be unemployed a year after their release. We also know, if you can't meet your basic economic needs, you're going to commit crime -- any of us would do that. So instead of building prisons, what we could build are spaces for job training and entrepreneurship. These are spaces for what we call ""restorative economics."" Located in East Oakland, California, ""Restore Oakland"" will be the country’s first center for restorative justice and restorative economics. (Applause) So here's what we're going to do. We're going to gut this building and turn it into three things. First, a restaurant called ""Colors,"" that will break the racial divide in the restaurant industry by training low-wage restaurant workers to get living-wage jobs in fine dining. It does not matter if you have a criminal record or not. On the second floor, we have bright, open, airy spaces to support a constellation of activist organizations to amplify their cry of ""Healthcare Not Handcuffs,"" and ""Housing as a human right."" And third, the county's first dedicated space for restorative justice, filled with nature, color, texture and spaces of refuge to support the dialogues here. This project breaks ground in just two months. And we have plans to replicate it in Washington D.C., Detroit, New York and New Orleans. (Applause) So you've seen two things we can build instead of prisons. And look, the price point is better. For one jail, we can build 30 restorative justice centers. (Applause) That is a better use of your tax dollars. So I want to build all of these. But building buildings is a really heavy lift. It takes time. And what was happening in the communities that I was serving is we were losing people every week to gun violence and mass incarceration. We needed to serve more people and faster and keep them out of the system. And a new idea emerged from the community, one that was a lot lighter on its feet. Instead of building prisons, we could build villages on wheels. It's called the Pop-Up Resource Village, and it brings an entire constellation of resources to isolated communities in the greater San Francisco area, including mobile medical, social services and pop-up shops. And so what we're doing now is we're building this whole village with the community, starting with transforming municipal buses into classrooms on wheels that bring GED and high school education across turf lines. (Applause) We will serve thousands of more students with this. We're creating mobile spaces of refuge for women released from jail in the middle of the night, at their most vulnerable. Next summer, the village will launch, and it pops up every single week, expanding to more and more communities as it goes. So look out for it. (Applause) So what do we build instead of prisons? We've looked at three things: peacemaking centers, centers for restorative justice and restorative economics and pop-up villages. But I'm telling you, I have a list a mile long. This is customized housing for youth transitioning out of foster care. These are reentry centers for women to reunite with their children. These are spaces for survivors of violence. These are spaces that address the root causes of mass incarceration. And not a single one of them is a jail or a prison. Activist, philosopher, writer Cornel West says that ""Justice is what love looks like in public."" So with this in mind, I ask you one more time to imagine a world without prisons, and join me in creating all the things that we could build instead. Thank you. (Applause)"
17:34,Howard C. Stevenson,How to resolve racially stressful situations,Feb 2018,"There's an African proverb that goes, ""The lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it."" More than a racial conversation, we need a racial literacy to decode the politics of racial threat in America. Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth, that the more we understand that our cultural differences represent the power to heal the centuries of racial discrimination, dehumanization and illness. Both of my parents were African-American. My father was born in Southern Delaware, my mother, North Philadelphia, and these two places are as different from each other as east is from west, as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama. My father's way of dealing with racial conflict was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy and I in church what seemed like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. (Laughter) If anybody bothered us because of the color of our skin, he believed that you should pray for them, knowing that God would get them back in the end. (Laughter) You could say that his racial-coping approach was spiritual -- for later on, one day, like Martin Luther King. My mother's coping approach was a little different. She was, uh, you could say, more relational -- right now, like, in your face, right now. More like Malcolm X. (Laughter) She was raised from neighborhoods in which there was racial violence and segregation, where she was chased out of neighborhoods, and she exacted violence to chase others out of hers. When she came to Southern Delaware, she thought she had come to a foreign country. She didn't understand anybody, particularly the few black and brown folks who were physically deferential and verbally deferential in the presence of whites. Not my mother. When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked. She didn't care what you thought. And she pissed a lot of people off with her cultural style. Before we get into the supermarket, she would give us the talk: ""Don't ask for nothin', don't touch nothin'. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I don't care if all the other children are climbing the walls. They're not my children. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"" In three-part harmony: ""Yes, Mom."" Before we'd get into the supermarket, that talk was all we needed. Now, how many of you ever got that talk? How many of you ever give that talk? (Laughter) How many of you ever give that talk today? My mother didn't give us the talk because she was worried about money or reputation or us misbehaving. We never misbehaved. We were too scared. We were in church 24 hours a day, seven days a week. (Laughter) She gave us that talk to remind us that some people in the world would interpret us as misbehaving just by being black. Not every parent has to worry about their children being misjudged because of the color of their skin, just by breathing. So we get into the supermarket, and people look at us -- stare at us as if we just stole something. Every now and then, a salesperson would do something or say something because they were pissed with our cultural style, and it would usually happen at the conveyor belt. And the worst thing they could do was to throw our food into the bag. And when that happened, it was on. (Laughter) My mother began to tell them who they were, who their family was, where to go, how fast to get there. (Laughter) If you haven't been cursed out by my mother, you haven't lived. (Laughter) The person would be on the floor, writhing in utter decay and decomposition, whimpering in a pool of racial shame. (Laughter) Now, both my parents were Christians. The difference is my father prayed before a racial conflict and my mother prayed after. (Laughter) There is a time, if you use both of their strategies, if you use them in the right time and the right way. But it's never a time -- there's a time for conciliation, there's a time for confrontation, but it's never a time to freeze up like a deer in the headlights, and it's never a time to lash out in heedless, thoughtless anger. The lesson in this is that when it comes to race relations, sometimes, we've got to know how to pray, think through, process, prepare. And other times, we've got to know how to push, how to do something. And I'm afraid that neither of these two skills -- preparing, pushing -- are prevalent in our society today. If you look at the neuroscience research which says that when we are racially threatened, our brains go on lockdown, and we dehumanize black and brown people. Our brains imagine that children and adults are older than they really are, larger than they really are and closer than they really are. When we're at our worst, we convince ourselves that they don't deserve affection or protection. At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we know that some of the scariest moments are racial encounters, some of the scariest moments that people will ever face. If you look at the police encounters that have led to some wrongful deaths of mostly Native Americans and African-Americans in this country, they've lasted about two minutes. Within 60 seconds, our brains go on lockdown. And when we're unprepared, we overreact. At best, we shut down. At worst, we shoot first and ask no questions. Imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our brains from going on lockdown. Imagine how many children would get to come home from school or 7-Eleven without getting expelled or shot. Imagine how many mothers and fathers wouldn't have to cry. Racial socialization can help young people negotiate 60-second encounters, but it's going to take more than a chat. It requires a racial literacy. Now, how do parents have these conversations, and what is a racial literacy? Thank you for asking. (Laughter) A racial literacy involves the ability to read, recast and resolve a racially stressful encounter. Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens and noticing our stress reactions to it. Recasting involves taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami interpretation of this moment and reducing it to a mountain-climbing experience, one that is -- from impossible situation to one that is much more doable and challenging. Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves being able to make a healthy decision that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, ""That didn't bother me,"" or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment. Now, we can teach parents and children how to read, recast and resolve using a mindfulness strategy we call: ""Calculate, locate, communicate, breathe and exhale."" Stay with me. ""Calculate"" asks, ""What feeling am I having right now, and how intense is it on a scale of one to 10?"" ""Locate"" asks, ""Where in my body do I feel it?"" And be specific, like the Native American girl at a Chicago fifth-grade school said to me, ""I feel angry at a nine because I'm the only Native American. And I can feel it in my stomach, like a bunch of butterflies are fighting with each other, so much so that they fly up into my throat and choke me."" The more detailed you can be, the easier it is to reduce that spot. ""Communicate"" asks, ""What self-talk and what images are coming in my mind?"" And if you really want help, try breathing in and exhaling slowly. With the help of my many colleagues at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we use in-the-moment stress-reduction in several research and therapy projects. One project is where we use basketball to help youth manage their emotions during 60-second eruptions on the court. Another project, with the help of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott, we leverage the cultural style of African-American barbershops, where we train black barbers to be health educators in two areas: one, to safely reduce the sexual risk in their partner relationships; and the other, to stop retaliation violence. The cool part is the barbers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18- to 24-year-old men while they're cutting their hair. Another project is where we teach teachers how to read, recast and resolve stressful moments in the classroom. And a final project, in which we teach parents and their children separately to understand their racial traumas before we bring them together to problem-solve daily microaggressions. Now, racially literate conversations with our children can be healing, but it takes practice. And I know some of you are saying, ""Practice? Practice? We're talking about practice?"" Yes, we are talking about practice. I have two sons. My oldest, Bryan, is 26, and my youngest, Julian, is 12. And we do not have time to talk about how that happened. (Laughter) But, when I think of them, they are still babies to me, and I worry every day that the world will misjudge them. In August of 2013, Julian, who was eight at the time, and I were folding laundry, which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence, I should have known something strange was going to happen. On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents, and they were crying because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman. And Julian was glued to the TV. He had a thousand questions, and I was not prepared. He wanted to know why: Why would a grown man stalk and hunt down and kill an unarmed 17-year-old boy? And I did not know what to say. The best thing that could come out of my mouth was, ""Julian, sometimes in this world, there are people who look down on black and brown people and do not treat them -- and children, too -- do not treat them as human."" He interpreted the whole situation as sad. (Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad. ""We don't care. You're not our kind."" HS: Yes. JS: It's like, ""We're better than you."" HS: Yes. JS: ""And there's nothing you can do about that. And if you scare me, or something like that, I will shoot you because I'm scared of you."" HS: Exactly. But if somebody's stalking you -- JS: It's not the same for everyone else. HS: It's not always the same, no. You've got to be careful. JS: Yeah, because people can disrespect you. HS: Exactly. JS: And think that you're, ""You don't look -- you don't look like you're ..."" It's like they're saying that ""You don't look right, so I guess I have the right to disrespect you."" HS: Yeah, and that's what we call, we call that racism. And we call that racism, Julian, and yes, some people -- other people -- can wear a hoodie, and nothing happens to them. But you and Trayvon might, and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe. (Voice-over) HS: And that's why -- JS: So you mean like, when you said ""other people,"" you mean, like if Trayvon was a white, um, that he wouldn't be disrespected like that? HS: Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people when I said, ""other people,"" all right? So there was a way in which I was so awkward in the beginning, but once I started getting my rhythm and my groove, I started talking about stereotypes and issues of discrimination, and just when I was getting my groove on, Julian interrupted me. (Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous, or you're a criminal because you're black, and you're a child or a boy -- That is wrong, it doesn't matter who does it. JS: Dad, I need to stop you there. HS: What? JS: Remember when we were ... HS: So he interrupts me to tell me a story about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend by two grown white men, which his mother confirmed. And I felt happy that he was able to talk about it; it felt like he was getting it. We moved from the sadness of Trayvon's parents and started talking about George Zimmerman's parents, which, I read in a magazine, condoned the stalking of Trayvon. And Julian's reaction to me was priceless. It made me feel like he was getting it. (Voice-over) JS: What did they say about him? HS: Well, I think they basically felt that he was justified to follow and stalk -- JS: What the -- ? HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong. JS: That's -- one minute. So they're saying he has the right to follow a black kid, get in a fight with him and shoot him? HS: As Julian was getting it, I started to lose it. Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking: What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon? I calculated my anger at a 10. I found, located, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably like I was running. And in my mind's eye, I could see somebody chasing Julian, and I was chasing them. And the only thing that could come out of my mouth was if anybody tries to bother my child ... (Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries to bother my child ... mmm, mmm, mmm. JS: What will happen? HS: Well, they better run. JS: Because what? HS: I'm gonna get 'em. JS: See? (Laughs) HS: I'm gonna get 'em. JS: Really? HS: Oh, yeah. JS: Then they're gonna get you because they might have weapons. HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna call police, too, like I should. But I feel like I wanna get 'em. But you can't; you're right, you can't just go chasing people. JS: They can be armed. HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right. I feel like I wanna chase 'em. JS: Plus they could be an army or something. HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna go get 'em, messing with my son. I don't like that. JS: Um ... HS: But you right. You gotta be careful. And um, you gotta be careful. You never know what some crazy people will think about you. Just as long as you believe you're beautiful like Daddy believes you're beautiful and handsome, and Mommy believes you're beautiful and handsome and smart. And you deserve to be on this planet, just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be. You can do anything you want, baby. HS: Racial socialization is not just what parents teach their children. It's also how children respond to what their parents teach. Is my child prepared? Can they recognize when a racial elephant shows up in a room? Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation down to a mountain-climbing adventure that they can engage and not run away? Can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds? Can I? Can you? Yes, we can. We can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, breathe and exhale in the middle of our most threatening moments, when we come face-to-face with our lesser selves. If you take the centuries of racial rage that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls -- and anything that affects our bodies, minds and souls affects our health -- we could probably use gun control for our hearts. I just want what all parents want for their children when we're not around: affection and protection. When police and teachers see my children, I want them to imagine their own, because I believe if you see our children as your children, you won't shoot them. With racial literacy, and yes, practice, we can decode the racial trauma from our stories, and our healing will come in the telling. But we must never forget that our cultural differences are full of affection and protection, and remember always that the lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
10:48,Bob Inglis,American bipartisan politics can be saved — here's how,Jan 2018,"Imagine that you're a member of Congress. You've worked very hard. You've knocked on thousands of doors, sweating and shivering, depending on the season. You've made hundreds, maybe thousands of phone calls to people you don't even know asking for their support, begging for their money. And now you've got one of these. It's hanging on a door in Washington, DC. It says you're a member of Congress, that you represent the people of your state. Now, imagine you're a conservative member of Congress. For some of you here in Boston, Massachusetts, that's going to take a powerful imagination, all right? (Laughter) But imagine with me that you're a conservative member of Congress. You grew up on Milton Friedman. You love his free markets, free enterprise and free trade. You've watched Ronald Reagan's farewell address over and over, and you cry every time -- (Laughter) he gets to the part about the shining city on the hill, and how if the city had to have walls, the walls had doors -- doors to let in those yearning to breathe free. You get goosebumps when you think of him telling Mr. Gorbachev to tear down his wall. You're a conservative member of Congress, and you agree with President John F. Kennedy that America is an exceptional place. For inspiration, you go to YouTube and you watch his speech at Rice University, September of 1962, the ""moon shot"" speech. And you're amazed that he admits in that speech -- a speech of 17 minutes of pure American exceptionalism -- that some of the materials needed for the spacecraft hadn't been invented yet. No matter. We're going to the Moon before the decade is out. You agree with him that the vows of this nation can be fulfilled only if we in this nation are first and therefore we intend to be first. You've taken as your own the affect that he so embodied: that when leaders are optimistic, they're saying they believe in the people they represent. You're a conservative member of Congress, and you believe in the precautionary principle. You believe in data-driven analysis. You know that climate change is real and human-caused, and you see in climate change a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment. One that calls for the greatness of your nation as much as the original Sputnik moment. You are a conservative member of Congress. You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp, and believe with him that the test of conservatism is that it works for everyone, regardless of skin color. You're appalled by the alt-right. You want them to have nothing to do with your brand, your party, your legacy. You utterly reject them. You -- (Applause) You're a conservative member of Congress. You rise with compassion to protect the lives of the unborn, but otherwise you think the bedroom of consenting adults is a rather strange place for the government to be. You are a conservative member of Congress. With John Adams, you fear the mob. Because you know, as he knew, that a mob is not able to protect liberty, not even its own. And you're amazed at the wisdom that he and other framers had in establishing a slow, deliberative governing process -- an inherently conservative governing process. It would serve a country. It would grow far greater than they could ever imagine. You are a conservative member of Congress. You fear the fire of populist nationalism, because you know that those who play with fire can't control it. You see their pitchforks and torches, and you know they're not good building tools. The pitchforks and torches can tear down and burn up but they can't build up. They can't build up the institutions and the communities so necessary to a stable and prosperous country. You're a conservative member of Congress, and you fear the next county party convention. You so wish for your party to be the grand opportunity party, not the grumpy old party. (Laughter) You know that they want to hear from you some old saw about how a secret Muslim, non-American socialist took over in the White House and destroyed the country, and you know that none of that's true. (Applause) You know that they want to hear you say that you're OK with insults, OK with ""lock her up"" chants and OK with policy pronouncements with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness that 140 characters can muster. You are a conservative member of Congress. You realize that many in your party look to some good old days that you know never existed. They hold on, for example, to the fossils that fueled the last century of growth, but you know that better, cleaner more abundant fuels await us, and you know that that abundance can lead the world to more energy, more mobility and more freedom. You're a conservative member of Congress. You realize that many in your party pine for the '50s and the '60s because those were, after all, the good old days. But you know that the Cuyahoga River was on fire back then. You know that in Pittsburgh, street lights came on at noon because of the soot in the air. The schools were segregated, neighborhoods redlined, that communism threatened freedom, and if you got cancer, you weren't likely to fight for long. You're a conservative member of Congress and you want to sound like JFK at Rice, where JFK said, ""It's understandable why some would have us stay where we are a little bit longer, to wait and to rest."" But everything within you says with him, this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. You are ready to lead. You are ready to prove the power of free enterprise to solve challenges like climate change. You are ready to lead. So I've got a suggestion for you then: lead ... now. Step out, step up. You know, we ask America's best to die on literal hills in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Is it too much to ask you to die a figurative death on a political hill in Washington, DC? You know, at the end of your time in Washington, they're going to take this plaque off the door. They're going to hand it to you; you're going to go home with it. Can you imagine the emptiness of knowing that you stood for nothing, that you risk nothing, that all you did was follow fearful people to where they were already going rather than trying to lead them to a better place? If you're not willing to lose your seat in Congress, there's really very little reason to be there. (Applause) So here's the thing: it's not too late. There's still time to lead. Speak out, speak up, call lunacy what it is: lunacy. Tell the American people that we still have moon shots in us. Tell the folks at the county party convention, ""You bet free enterprise can solve climate change."" Tell them that Milton Friedman would say to tax pollution rather than profits. Tell them that it's OK -- no, it's a good thing that progressives would agree. Tell them the very good news that we can bring America together to solve these challenges and to lead the world. Tell them that free enterprise can do these things. Tell them that America must stop the dividing, and must start the uniting. Tell them. Play your part before it's too late. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)"
14:11,Paul Hessburg,Why wildfires have gotten worse — and what we can do about it,Nov 2017,"As you've probably noticed, in recent years, a lot of western forests have burned in large and destructive wildfires. If you're like me -- this western landscape is actually why my family and I live here. And as a scientist and a father, I've become deeply concerned about what we're leaving behind for our kids, and now my five grandkids. In the US, an area that's larger than the state of Oregon has burned in just the last 10 years, and tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. Acres burned and homes destroyed have steadily increased over the last three decades, and individual fires that are bigger than 100,000 acres -- they're actually on the rise. These are what we call ""megafires."" Megafires are the result of the way we've managed this western landscape over the last 150 years in a steadily warming climate. Much of the destruction that we are currently seeing could actually have been avoided. I've spent my entire career studying these western landscapes, and the science is pretty clear: if we don't change a few of our fire-management habits, we're going to lose many more of our beloved forests. Some won't recover in our lifetime or my kids' lifetime. It's time we confront some tough truths about wildfires, and come to understand that we need to learn to better live with them and change how they come to our forests, our homes and our communities. So why is this happening? Well, that's what I want to talk to you about today. You see this forest? Isn't it beautiful? Well, the forests that we see today look nothing like the forests of 100 or 150 years ago. Thankfully, panoramic photos were taken in the 1930s from thousands of western mountaintop lookouts, and they show a fair approximation of the forest that we inherited. The best word to describe these forests of old is ""patchy."" The historical forest landscape was this constantly evolving patchwork of open and closed canopy forests of all ages, and there was so much evidence of fire. And most fires were pretty small by today's standards. And it's important to understand that this landscape was open, with meadows and open canopy forests, and it was the grasses of the meadows and in the grassy understories of the open forest that many of the wildfires were carried. There were other forces at work, too, shaping this historical patchwork: for example, topography, whether a place faces north or south or it's on a ridge top or in a valley bottom; elevation, how far up the mountain it is; and weather, whether a place gets a lot of snow and rain, sunlight and warmth. These things all worked together to shape the way the forest grew. And the way the forest grew shaped the way fire behaved on the landscape. There was crosstalk between the patterns and the processes. You can see the new dry forest. Trees were open grown and fairly far apart. Fires were frequent here, and when they occurred, they weren't that severe, while further up the mountain, in the moist and the cold forests, trees were more densely grown and fires were less frequent, but when they occurred, they were quite a bit more severe. These different forest types, the environments that they grew in and fire severity -- they all worked together to shape this historical patchwork. And there was so much power in this patchwork. It provided a natural mechanism to resist the spread of future fires across the landscape. Once a patch of forest burned, it helped to prevent the flow of fire across the landscape. A way to think about it is, the burned patches helped the rest of the forest to be forest. Let's add humans to the mix. For 10,000 years, Native Americans lived on this landscape, and they intentionally burned it -- a lot. They used fire to burn meadows and to thin certain forests so they could grow more food. They used fire to increase graze for the deer and the elk and the bison that they hunted. And most importantly, they figured out if they burned in the spring and the fall, they could avoid the out-of-control fires of summer. European settlement -- it occurred much later, in the mid-1800s, and by the 1880s, livestock grazing was in high gear. I mean, if you think about it, the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses which had been the conveyer belt for the historical fires, and this prevented once-frequent fires from thinning out trees and burning up dead wood. Later came roads and railroads, and they acted as potent firebreaks, interrupting further the flow of fire across this landscape. And then something happened which caused a sudden pivot in our society. In 1910, we had a huge wildfire. It was the size of the state of Connecticut. We called it ""the Big Burn."" It stretched from eastern Washington to western Montana, and it burned, in a few days, three million acres, devoured several towns, and it killed 87 people. Most of them were firefighters. Because of the Big Burn, wildfire became public enemy number one, and this would shape the way that we would think about wildfire in our society for the next hundred years. Thereafter, the Forest Service, just five years young at the time, was tasked with the responsibility of putting out all wildfires on 193 million acres of public lands, and they took this responsibility very seriously. They developed this unequaled ability to put fires out, and they put out 95 to 98 percent of all fires every single year in the US. And from this point on, it was now fire suppression and not wildfires that would become a prime shaper of our forests. After World War II, timber harvesting got going in the west, and the logging removed the large and the old trees. These were survivors of centuries of wildfires. And the forest filled in. Thin-barked, fire-sensitive small trees filled in the gaps, and our forests became dense, with trees so layered and close together that they were touching each other. So fires were unintentionally blocked by roads and railroads, the cattle and sheep ate the grass, then along comes fire suppression and logging, removing the big trees, and you know what happened? All these factors worked together to allow the forest to fill in, creating what I call the current epidemic of trees. (Laughter) Go figure. (Laughter) More trees than the landscape can support. So when you compare what forests looked like 100 years ago and today, the change is actually remarkable. Notice how the patchwork has filled in. Dry south slopes -- they're now covered with trees. A patchwork that was once sculptured by mostly small and sort of medium-sized fires has filled in. Do you see the blanket of trees? After just 150 years, we have a dense carpet of forest. But there's more. Because trees are growing so close together, and because tree species, tree sizes and ages are so similar across large areas, fires not only move easily from acre to acre, but now, so do diseases and insect outbreaks, which are killing or reducing the vitality of really large sections of forest now. And after a century without fire, dead branches and downed trees on the forest floor, they're at powder-keg levels. What's more, our summers are getting hotter and they're getting drier and they're getting windier. And the fire season is now 40 to 80 days longer each year. Because of this, climatologists are predicting that the area burned since 2000 will double or triple in the next three decades. And we're building houses in the middle of this. Two recently published studies tell us that more than 60 percent of all new housing starts are being built in this flammable and dangerous mess. So when we do get a fire, large areas can literally go up in smoke. How do you feel now about the forest image that I first showed you? It scares the heck out of me. So what do we do? We need to restore the power of the patchwork. We need to put the right kind of fire back into the system again. It's how we can resize the severity of many of our future fires. And the silver lining is that we have tools and we have know-how to do this. Let's look at some of the tools. We can use prescribed burning to intentionally thin out trees and burn up dead fuels. We do this to systematically reduce them and keep them reduced. And what is that going to do? It's going to create already-burned patches on the landscape that will resist the flow of future fires. We can combine mechanical thinning with some of these treatments where it's appropriate to do so, and capture some commercial value and perhaps underwrite some of these treatments, especially around urban areas. And the best news of all is that prescribed burning produces so much less smoke than wildfires do. It's not even close. But there's a hitch: prescribed burning smoke is currently regulated under air quality rules as an avoidable nuisance. But wildfire smoke? It simply gets a pass. Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs) So you know what happens? We do far too little prescribed burning, and we continually eat smoke in the summers from megafires. We all need to work together to get this changed. And finally, there's managed wildfires. Instead of putting all the fires out, we need to put some of them back to work thinning forests and reducing dead fuels. We can herd them around the landscape when it's appropriate to do so to help restore the power of the patchwork. And as you've probably figured out by now, this is actually a social problem. It's got ecological and climate explanations, but it's a social problem, and it will take us humans to solve it. Public support for these tools is poor. Prescribed burning and managed wildfires are not well-supported. We actually all simply want fires to magically go away and take that pesky smoke with them, don't we? But there is no future without lots of fire and lots of smoke. That option is actually not on the table. Until we, the owners of public lands, make it our high priority to do something about the current situation, we're going to experience continued losses to megafires. So it's up to us. We can spread this message to our lawmakers, folks who can help us manage our fires and our forests. If we're unsuccessful, where will you go to play when your favorite places are burned black? Where will you go to breathe deep and slow? Thank you. (Applause)"
11:59,Euna Lee,What I learned as a prisoner in North Korea,Sep 2017,"I recently read about what the young generation of workers want in Harvard Business Review. One thing that stuck out to me was: don't just talk about impact, but make an impact. I'm a little bit older than you, maybe much older than you, but this is exactly the same goal that I had when I was in college. I wanted to make my own impact for those who live under injustice; it's the reason that I became a documentary journalist, the reason I became a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days. It was March 17, 2009. It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you, but it was the day that turned my life upside down. My team and I were making a documentary about North Korean refugees living below human life in China. We were at the border. It was our last day of filming. There was no wire fence or bars or sign to show that it is the border, but this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use as an escape route. It was still winter, and the river was frozen. When we were in the middle of the frozen river, we were filming about the condition of the cold weather and the environment that North Koreans had to deal with when they seek their freedom. And suddenly, one of my team members shouted, ""Soldiers!"" So I looked back, and there were two small soldiers in green uniforms with rifles, chasing after us. We all ran as fast as we could. I prayed that, please don't let them shoot my head. And I was thinking that, if my feet are on Chinese soil, I'll be safe. And I made it to Chinese soil. Then I saw my colleague Laura Ling fall on her knees. I didn't know what to do at that short moment, but I knew that I could not leave her alone there when she said, ""Euna, I can't feel my legs."" In a flash, we were surrounded by these two Korean soldiers. They were not much bigger than us, but they were determined to take us to their army base. I begged and yelled for any kind of help, hoping that someone would show up from China. Here I was, being stubborn towards a trained soldier with a gun. I looked at his eyes. He was just a boy. At that moment, he raised his rifle to hit me, but I saw that he was hesitating. His eyes were shaking, and his rifle was still up in the air. So I shouted at him, ""OK, OK, I'll walk with you."" And I got up. When we arrived at their army base, my head was spinning with these worst-case scenarios, and my colleague's statement wasn't helping. She said, ""We are the enemy."" She was right: we were the enemy. And I was supposed to be frightened, too. But I kept having these odd experiences. This time, an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm, because I lost my coat on the frozen river while battling with one of these soldiers. I will tell you what I mean by these odd experiences. I grew up in South Korea. To us, North Korea was always the enemy, even before I was born. South and North have been under armistice for 63 years, since the end of the Korean War. And growing up in the South in the '80s and '90s, we were taught propaganda about North Korea. And we heard so many graphic stories, such as, a little young boy being brutally killed by North Korean spies just because he said, ""I don't like communists."" Or, I watched this cartoon series about a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig, which represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time. And the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over instilled one word in a young mind: ""enemy."" And I think at some point, I dehumanized them, and the people of North Korea became equated with the North Korean government. Now, back to my detention. It was the second day of being in a cell. I had not slept since I was out at the border. This young guard came to my cell and offered me this small boiled egg and said, ""This will give you strength to keep going."" Do you know what it is like, receiving a small kindness in the enemy's hand? Whenever they were kind to me, I thought the worst case was waiting for me after the kindness. One officer noticed my nervousness. He said, ""Did you think we were all these red pigs?"" referring to the cartoon that I just showed you. Every day was like a psychological battle. The interrogator had me sit at a table six days a week and had me writing down about my journey, my work, over and over until I wrote down the confession that they wanted to hear. After about three months of detention, the North Korean court sentenced me to 12 years in a labor camp. So I was just sitting in my room to be transferred. At that time, I really had nothing else to do, so I paid attention to these two female guards and listened to what they were talking about. Guard A was older, and she studied English. She seemed like she came from an affluent family. She often showed up with these colorful dresses, and then loved to show off. And Guard B was the younger one, and she was a really good singer. She loved to sing Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" -- sometimes too much. She knew just how to torture me without knowing. (Laughter) And this girl spent a lot of time in the morning to put on makeup, like you can see in any young girl's life. And they loved to watch this Chinese drama, a better quality production. I remember Guard B said, ""I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this."" She got scolded for degrading her own country's produced TV shows. Guard B had more of a free mind than Guard A, and she often got scolded by Guard A whenever she expressed herself. One day, they invited all these female colleagues -- I don't know where they came from -- to where I was held, and they invited me to their guard room and asked if one-night stands really happen in the US. (Laughter) This is the country where young couples are not even allowed to hold hands in public. I had no idea where they had gotten this information, but they were shy and giggly even before I said anything. I think we all forgot that I was their prisoner, and it was like going back to my high school classroom again. And I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon, but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US. I started to understand where these people's anger was coming from. If these girls grew up learning that we are enemies, it was just natural that they would hate us just as I feared them. But at that moment, we were all just girls who shared the same interests, beyond our ideologies that separated us. I shared these stories with my boss at Current TV at the time after I came home. His first reaction was, ""Euna, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?"" Yes, and I clearly remember the feeling of fear and being threatened, and tension rising up between me and the interrogator when we talked about politics. There definitely was a wall that we couldn't climb over. But we were able to see each other as human beings when we talked about family, everyday life, the importance of the future for our children. It was about a month before I came home. I got really sick. Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye, because she was leaving the detention center. She made sure that no one watched us, no one heard us, and quietly said, ""I hope you get better and go back to your family soon."" It is these people -- the officer who brought me his coat, the guard who offered me a boiled egg, these female guards who asked me about dating life in the US -- they are the ones that I remember of North Korea: humans just like us. North Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries, but I believe that we were representing the human race. Now I'm back home and back to my life. The memory of these people has blurred as time has passed. And I'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US. I realized how easy it is to see them as an enemy again. But I have to keep reminding myself that when I was over there, I was able to see humanity over hatred in my enemy's eyes. Thank you. (Applause)"
18:20,Theo E.J. Wilson,A Black man goes undercover in the alt-right,Sep 2017,"I took a cell phone and accidentally made myself famous. (Laughter) I was just talking about the things that I cared about, but with the click of a button and an incendiary viral video I propelled myself into overnight stardom. When I say overnight, I mean I literally woke up the next morning with so many notifications on my phone, I thought I slept through a national tragedy. (Laughter) It was the craziest thing, guys, but when it came to my influence and my exposure, I literally took a quantum leap. So I made more videos and the subject matter of my videos was often the most divisive subject in American life, but it was the way that I articulated race that made me somewhat of a digital lightning rod. See, being a survivor myself of police brutality and having lost a childhood friend, Alonzo Ashley, at the hands of the police, I had a little something to say about the topic. You see, this was at the height of the Black Lives Matter furor and people seemed to be turning to me to articulate their viewpoints, and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming. You see, the internet has this interesting quality. In one way, it totally brought the world together, and I remember being a kid and all of this utopian propaganda was being dumped on us about how the World Wide Web was going to span the reaches of people across the globe. But as it turns out, people are people. (Laughter) And this magical superhighway also took the demons of our nature and gave them Ferraris. (Laughter) You see, technology, y'all, is a lot like money. It just brings out what's already inside you and amplifies it. And so I soon became familiar with the phenomenon of the internet troll. These guys seem to live beneath the bridges of said superhighway -- (Laughter) And they also missed the memo about the enlightenment of the internet age. I remember being called highly colorful racial slurs by those who use the anonymity of the internet as a Klan hood. And some of them were pretty creative, actually, but others were pretty wounding, especially navigating the post-traumatic world of a police brutality survivor in the height of Black Lives Matter, with all of these people being killed on my timeline. To these trolls, I wasn't a human. I was an idea, an object, a caricature. Did I mention that this race stuff can be kind of divisive? You see, I'm an innately curious person and as I drew my sword to engage in epic battles in the comment section -- (Laughter) I also began to notice that a few of my trolls actually had brains, which made me even more curious and what to understand them even further. And although these supposed morons engaged in what appeared to be original thought, I said to myself, ""Um, these guys are highly misinformed, at least according to my knowledge."" Where are these guys getting these arguments from? Like, was there some kind of alternative universe with alternative facts? (Laughter) (Applause) Was history and gravity optional over there? I don't know. But I needed to know. Like, I wanted to know. And as it turns out, I had no idea about digital echo chambers. That same target marketing algorithm that feeds you more of the products you like to buy also feeds you more of the news that you like to hear. I had been living in an online universe that just reflected my worldview back to me. So my timeline was pretty liberal. I had no Breitbart or Infowars or Fox News. No, no, I was all MSNBC and The Daily Show, CNN and theGrio, right? Well, these trolls were hopping the dimensional doorway and I needed to figure out how. (Laughter) So what I decided to do was trick the Facebook algorithm into feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with, and this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough, because my online footprint already established the patterns that I like to hear. So with the anonymity of the internet, I went undercover. (Laughter) I set up this ghost profile and went crazy. Now, on a practical level, it was very simple, but on an emotional level, it was kind of daunting, especially with the racist vitriol that I had experienced. But what I didn't realize is that my trolls were inoculating me, thickening my skin, making me immune to viewpoints that I didn't necessarily agree with, and so I didn't react to the same things as I would have several months prior. All right? So I pressed on. Noticing that this stuff also worked on YouTube, I became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker -- (Laughter) And digitally I began to infiltrate the infamous alt-right movement. Now, my doppelgänger was Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character -- (Laughter) a sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier. And to think, like, years ago, I would have needed acting training and, like, makeup and a fake ID. Now I could just lurk. And so I started with a little Infowars, went on into some American Renaissance, National Vanguard Alliance, and, you know, I started commenting on videos, talking bad about Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter. I started bemoaning race baiters like Eric Holder and Barack Obama and just mirroring the antiblack sentiments that were thrown at me. And to be honest, it was kind of exhilarating. (Laughter) Like, I would literally spend days clicking through my new racist profile -- (Laughter) Goofing off at work in Aryan land. It was something else. (Laughter) And so I then started visiting some of the pages of my former trolls, and a lot of these guys were just regular Joes, a lot of outdoorsmen, hunters, computer nerds, some of them family guys with videos of their families. I mean, for all I know, some of y'all could be in this room right now. Right? (Laughter) But when I went undercover, I found a lovely plethora of characters, luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and David Duke. All of these guys were thought leaders in their own right, but over time, the alt-right movement ended up using their information to fuel their momentum. And I'm going to tell you what else led to the momentum of the alt-right: the left wing's wholesale demonization of everything white and male. If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, you're in league with Satan. (Laughter) Now, would you believe, would you believe that some people find that offensive? And -- (Laughter) And so, I mean, listen, the fact is that millennials get a lifetime of diet brand history. I mean, America seems to be hellbent on filling its textbooks with CliffsNotes versions of its dark past. This severely, severely decontextualizes race and the anger associated with it, and that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow. Add in the wild landscape of the internet and it's easy to sell rebranded ""Mein Kampf"" ideas to a generation who has been failed by public schools. A lot of these ideas, easily debunked. Alt-facts have that quality. However, one theme kept screaming at me through the subtext of those arguments, and that was, why should I be hated for who I cannot help but be? Now, as a black man in America, that resonated with me. I have spent so much time defending myself against attempts to demonize me and make me apologize for who I am, trying to portray me as something that I'm not, some kind of thug or gangster, a menace to society. Unexpected compassion. Wow. Now, listen, the historical source of the demonization of black males and white males is highly different, and where you fall on this argument, sadly, tends to be an accident of birth. Now, you're probably surprised by this perspective, and so was I. Never in a billion years did I think that I could have some kind of compassion for people who hated my guts. Now, mind you, not enough compassion like I want to be friends. I don't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who, like, would not want to see me on this planet. Right? But just enough compassion to understand how they got to where they are. And to be honest, there were a couple of fair points. One of them was how liberals have this wide acceptance for everybody except for those with honestly held conservative viewpoints. (Laughter) Heaven forbid you love God, this country and mean it. Right? And another thing that they talked about was this fear that they had of something that they labeled as ""white genocide,"" that diversity would be a force that would wipe them out. Now listen, I know what it is to fear for the fate of your people. Between crack, AIDS, gang violence, mass incarceration, gentrification, police shootings, black people have more than enough reasons to stay up at night. But if nature is into diversity and you are not, you're going to lose that fight, buddy. (Laughter) (Applause) You see, nature doesn't care about your race. That's man-made. Nature just cares about healthy organisms, and your precious ethnic features are expendable to that aim. So the moment that you let go of that racist identity and relatch onto humanity, all your problems go away. (Applause) I'm going to tell you what race ain't about to die out: the human race. Join the party. The water's great. Until the water gets too hot, but that's another TED Talk. (Laughter) The point is that to get to this point of understanding, you have to let go of that fear and embrace your curiosity, and sadly, too many people will not take that journey to see the world from the other side. And, I mean, let's be honest, that doesn't just go for progressives, but also to the right wing and conservatives. You know, as fair as some of their points were, they were still trapped in their own echo chambers, recycling old, outdated points of view, never getting a diversity in perspective, not making them well-rounded in their worldview. So they're not hearing certain anti-racist and political voices, voices like Tim Wise and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed. All of these voices have the answers to the questions that they want, but unfortunately they will not hear them due to the power of these echo chambers. We have got to break out of these digital divides, because as our technology advances, the consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous. And this whole experience taught me something: our gadgets ain't going to save us. All these technological devices are only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here. And so that's all IQ, not EQ. That's a dangerous imbalance. Where do you get the emotional intelligence, the character development, the virtues of patience, forbearance, compassion, you know, the things that make sure that these devices, however advanced, become a blessing and not a curse? Seems to be me that humanity itself needs an upgrade. Now -- (Applause) That's a big task, understandably, but I don't believe in any kind of unbeatable monster. There was no giant out there without perhaps a simple Achilles heel. And what if I told you that one of the best ways to actually overcome this is to have courageous conversations with difficult people, people who do not see the world the same way that you see the world? Oh yes, folks, conversations may be indeed the key to that upgrade, because remember, language was the first form of virtual reality. It is literally a symbolic representation of the physical world, and through this device, we change the physical world. Keep in mind, conversations stop violence, conversations start countries, they build bridges, and when the chips are down, conversations are the last tools that humans use before they pick up their guns. And I ain't talking about online safe conversations from the security of your laptop. No. I'm talking about in-your-face conversations with real, breathing people. And for me, this looks like running a community forum called Shop Talk Live. Now, in Shop Talk Live -- somebody's been there, right? In Shop Talk Live, we have the conversations that change lives. We meet the community right where they are, and we've done everything from divert gang violence in real time to help find people jobs to mentoring homeless youth. And the reason why we needed to do this is because there was a severe lack of trust in the black community due to the violence of the crack era. And so we ended up taking agency into our own hands, solving our own problems, not waiting for anybody else. And the truth is, from the mayor to the felon, you're going to find them in that barber shop. And so what we did was just organize what was already going on. And so what I started doing was mining these alternative viewpoints from these alternative digital universes, dissecting them, breaking them down into controversial talking points. Then, with my cell phone, I flipped the internet against itself and began to broadcast these live conversations to my online followers. This made them want to leave the safety of their laptops and meet us in person to have real conversations with real people in real life. And we did this. Thank you. (Applause) Sometimes I sit back, and I reflect on the paradox of me just trying to solve the problems, us trying to solve the problems in our own communities -- we build bridges to so many other communities, from the LGBTQ community to the Arab immigrant community and even sat down with somebody with a Confederate flag on their hat and talked about the things that actually matter. It is time that we stop trying to hack our way around the human experience. There is no way out of each other. Stop trying to find one. (Applause) We have to understand something. Human beings all want the same things and we have to go through each other to get these things. These courageous conversations are the way that these bridges are built. It's time that we start seeing people as people and not simply the ideas that we project onto them or react to. Human beings are not the barriers but the gateways to the very things that we want. This is a collective and conscious evolution. My journey began with a terribly popular cell phone video and a fallen friend. Your journey begins right about now. Join the renaissance in human connection. It is going to happen with or without you. My suggestion: pick a topic, and start a community dialogue in your neck of the woods. Meet folks back in real life. And I'm going to tell you, when you trick the algorithm of your existence, you will get some diversified experiences. It is time to grow, people. And when we do this, not if, it will be clear that the key to this upgrade was always our inner world, not some device that we create, and the doorways to this experience is now, and will forever be, each other. Thank you. (Applause)"
7:56,Duarte Geraldino,What we're missing in the debate about immigration,Sep 2017,"So, Ma was trying to explain something to me about Grandma and when they grew up, but I couldn't pay attention to her because I was five years old, and I was petrified. I had just seen The Green Lady. Now, about a week earlier, I'd watched that movie ""Godzilla,"" the one about that huge lizard-like beast storming a major city, and the thought of a green monster coming for me was stuck in my mind. And yet there I was, at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom, just staring at her: her horns, her muscles -- all of it just frightened me. And I didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero. So I decided to consult the Google of the day -- ""Ma! Ma!"" (Laughter) My mother explained that The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty and that she was waving immigrants in. Now, the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head was the fact that, according to Ma, long before us, The Green Lady was actually brown, brown like me, and that she changed colors over the years, much like America. Now, the part that really is intriguing about this is that when she changed colors, she made me think about myself. It all made sense to me, because as a first-generation American, I was surrounded by immigrants. In fact, within my immediate social circle of the people who support me, who enrich my life, at least two are foreign-born. My life as a US citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers, and chances are, so is yours. There are more than 40 million immigrants in the USA. According to census data, a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign-born parent. I know all these statistics because I study global migration patterns. I'm a journalist, and for the last few years, I've been documenting the lives of US citizens who've lost people to deportation. And the numbers are enormous. From 2008 to 2016, more than three million people were ""ordered removed"" -- that's the technical term for being deported. There is an economic, a political, a psychological and an emotional cost to those deportations -- the moments when these circles are broken. I once asked a US soldier, ""Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"" And she told me, ""Because I'm proud to defend my country."" But I pressed to know -- ""Really, when you're on base, and you hear bombs exploding in the distance, and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured, in that moment, when you know you could be next, what does 'my country' mean?"" She looked at me. ""My country is my wife, my family, my friends, my soldiers."" What she was telling me is that ""my country"" is a collection of these strong relationships; these social circles. When the social circles are weakened, a country itself is weaker. We're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy. Rather than focusing on individuals, we should focus on the circles around them, because these are the people who are left behind: the voters, the taxpayers, the ones who are suffering that loss. And it's not just the children of the deported who are impacted. You have brothers and sisters who are separated by borders. You have classmates, teachers, law enforcement officers, technologists, scientists, doctors, who are all scrambling to make sense of new realities when their social circles are broken. These are the real lives behind all these statistics that dominate discussions about immigration policy. But we don't often think about them. And I'm trying to change that. Here's just one of the real-life stories that I've collected. And it still haunts me. I met Ramon and his son in 2016, the same year both of them were being ordered out of the country. Ramon was being deported to Latin America, while his son, who was a sergeant in the US military, was being deployed. Deported ... deployed. If you just look at Ramon's case, it wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is. But consider his son: a US citizen defending a country that's banished his father. The social circle is what's key here. Here's another example that illustrates those critical bonds. A group of citizens in Philadelphia were concerned about their jobs, because the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked was an undocumented immigrant, and immigration officials had picked him up. They rallied behind him. An immigration lawyer argued he was too important to the local community to be deported. At the hearing, they even submitted restaurant reviews -- restaurant reviews! In the end, a judge exercised what's called ""judicial discretion"" and allowed him to stay in the country, but only because they considered the social circle. There are 23 million noncitizens in the USA, according to verifiable federal data. And that doesn't include the undocumented, because numbers for that population are at best complex estimates. Let's just work with what we have. That's 23 million social circles -- about 100 million individuals whose lives could be impacted by deportation. And the stress of it all is trickling down through the population. A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents found that 30 percent of citizens in LA County are stressed about deportation, not because they themselves could be removed, but rather, because members of their social circle were at risk. I am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported; don't confuse me with that. But what I am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture. If you are within the sound of my voice, I want you to close your eyes for a moment and examine your own social circle. Who are your foreign-born? What would it feel like if the circle were broken? Share your story. I'm building a global archive of first-person accounts and linking them with mapping technology, so that we can see exactly where these circles break, because this is not just an American issue. There are a quarter-billion migrants around the world; people living, loving and learning in countries where they were not born. And in my career, in my life, I've been one of them: in China, in Africa, in Europe. And each time I become one of these foreigners -- one of these strange-looking guys in a new land -- I can't help but think back to that day when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom all those decades ago, when I was scared, and I had just spotted that green lady. And I guess the question that I keep on thinking about when I see her and all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown, and even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning as not quite green -- when I look at all of that, the question that my research seeks to answer becomes, to me, the same one that confounded me all those years ago: Is she a monster or a hero? Thank you. (Applause)"
14:25,Jennifer Granick,How the US government spies on people who protest — including you,Aug 2017,"We are all activists now. (Applause) Thank you. I'll just stop here. (Laughter) From the families who are fighting to maintain funding for public schools, the tens of thousands of people who joined Occupy Wall Street or marched with Black Lives Matter to protest police brutality against African Americans, families that join rallies, pro-life and pro-choice, those of us who are afraid that our friends and neighbors are going to be deported or that they'll be added to lists because they are Muslim, people who advocate for gun rights and for gun control and the millions of people who joined the women's marches all across the country this last January. (Applause) We are all activists now, and that means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance. Surveillance means government collection and use of private and sensitive data about us. And surveillance is essential to law enforcement and to national security. But the history of surveillance is one that includes surveillance abuses where this sensitive information has been used against people because of their race, their national origin, their sexual orientation, and in particular, because of their activism, their political beliefs. About 53 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I have a dream"" speech on the Mall in Washington. And today the ideas behind this speech of racial equality and tolerance are so noncontroversial that my daughters study the speech in third grade. But at the time, Dr. King was extremely controversial. The legendary and notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed, or wanted to believe, that the Civil Rights Movement was a Soviet communist plot intended to destabilize the American government. And so Hoover had his agents put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms, and those bugs picked up conversations between civil rights leaders talking about the strategies and tactics of the Civil Rights Movement. They also picked up sounds of Dr. King having sex with women who were not his wife, and J. Edgar Hoover saw the opportunity here to discredit and undermine the Civil Rights Movement. The FBI sent a package of these recordings along with a handwritten note to Dr. King, and a draft of this note was found in FBI archives years later, and the letter said, ""You are no clergyman and you know it. King, like all frauds, your end is approaching."" The letter even seemed to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide, saying, ""King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation."" But the important thing is, Dr. King was not abnormal. Every one of us has something that we want to hide from somebody. And even more important, J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either. The history of surveillance abuses is not the history of one bad, megalomaniacal man. Throughout his decades at the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support of the presidents that he served, Democratic and Republican alike. After all, it was John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy who knew about and approved the surveillance of Dr. King. Hoover ran a program called COINTELPRO for 15 years which was designed to spy on and undermine civic groups that were devoted to things like civil rights, the Women's Rights Movement, and peace groups and anti-war movements. And the surveillance didn't stop there. Lyndon Baines Johnson, during the election campaign, had the campaign airplane of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged as part of his effort to win that election. And then, of course, there was Watergate. Burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel, the Nixon administration was involved in covering up the burglary, and eventually Nixon had to step down as president. COINTELPRO and Watergate were a wake-up call for Americans. Surveillance was out of control and it was being used to squelch political challengers. And so Americans rose to the occasion and what we did was we reformed surveillance law. And the primary tool we used to reform surveillance law was to require a search warrant for the government to be able to get access to our phone calls and our letters. Now, the reason why a search warrant is important is because it interposes a judge in the relationship between investigators and the citizens, and that judge's job is to make sure that there's good cause for the surveillance, that the surveillance is targeted at the right people, and that the information that's collected is going to be used for legitimate government purposes and not for discriminatory ones. This was our system, and what this means is that President Obama did not wiretap Trump Tower. The system is set up to prevent something like that from happening without a judge being involved. But what happens when we're not talking about phone calls or letters anymore? Today, we have technology that makes it cheap and easy for the government to collect information on ordinary everyday people. Your phone call records can reveal whether you have an addiction, what your religion is, what charities you donate to, what political candidate you support. And yet, our government collected, dragnet-style, Americans' calling records for years. In 2012, the Republican National Convention highlighted a new technology it was planning to use, facial recognition, to identify people who were going to be in the crowd who might be activists or troublemakers and to stop them ahead of time. Today, over 50 percent of American adults have their faceprint in a government database. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives concocted a plan to find out what Americans were going to gun shows by using license plate detectors to scan the license plates of cars that were in the parking lots of these events. Today, we believe that over 70 percent of police departments have automatic license plate detection technology that they're using to track people's cars as they drive through town. And all of this information, the license plates, the faceprints, the phone records, your address books, your buddy lists, the photos that you upload to Dropbox or Google Photos, and sometimes even your chats and your emails are not protected by a warrant requirement. So what that means is we have all of this information on regular people that's newly available at very low expense. It is the golden age for surveillance. Now, every parent is going to understand what this means. When you have a little baby and the baby's young, that child is not able to climb out of its crib. But eventually your little girl gets older and she's able to climb out of the crib, but you tell her, ""Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"" And every parent knows what's going to happen. Some of those babies are going to climb out of the crib. Right? That's the difference between ability and permission. Well, the same thing is true with the government today. It used to be that our government didn't have the ability to do widespread, massive surveillance on hundreds of millions of Americans and then abuse that information. But now our government has grown up, and we have that technology today. The government has the ability, and that means the law is more important than ever before. The law is supposed to say when the government has permission to do it, and it's supposed to ensure that there's some kind of ramification. We notice when those laws are broken and there's some of kind of ramification or punishment. The law is more important than ever because we are now living in a world where only rules are stopping the government from abusing this information. But the law has fallen down on the job. Particularly since September 11 the law has fallen down on the job, and we do not have the rules in place that we need. And we are seeing the ramifications of that. So fusion centers are these joint task forces between local, state and federal government that are meant to ferret out domestic terrorism. And what we've seen is fusion center reports that say that you might be dangerous if you voted for a third-party candidate, or you own a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag, or you watched movies that are anti-tax. These same fusion centers have spied on Muslim community groups' reading lists and on Quakers who are resisting military recruiting in high schools. The Internal Revenue Service has disproportionately audited groups that have ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their name. And now customs and border patrol is stopping people as they come into the country and demanding our social networking passwords which will allow them to see who our friends are, what we say and even to impersonate us online. Now, civil libertarians like myself have been trying to draw people's attention to these things and fighting against them for years. This was a huge problem during the Obama administration, but now the problem is worse. When the New York Police Department spies on Muslims or a police department uses license plate detectors to find out where the officers' spouses are or those sorts of things, that is extremely dangerous. But when a president repurposes the power of federal surveillance and the federal government to retaliate against political opposition, that is a tyranny. And so we are all activists now, and we all have something to fear from surveillance. But just like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King, we can reform the way things are. First of all, use encryption. Encryption protects your information from being inexpensively and opportunistically collected. It rolls back the golden age for surveillance. Second, support surveillance reform. Did you know that if you have a friend who works for the French or German governments or for an international human rights group or for a global oil company that your friend is a valid foreign intelligence target? And what that means is that when you have conversations with that friend, the US government may be collecting that information. And when that information is collected, even though it's conversations with Americans, it can then be funneled to the FBI where the FBI is allowed to search through it without getting a warrant, without probable cause, looking for information about Americans and whatever crimes we may have committed with no need to document any kind of suspicion. The law that allows some of this to happen is called Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and we have a great opportunity this year, because Section 702 is going to expire at the end of 2017, which means that Congress's inertia is on our side if we want reform. And we can pressure our representatives to actually implement important reforms to this law and protect our data from this redirection and misuse. And finally, one of the reasons why things have gotten so out of control is because so much of what happens with surveillance -- the technology, the enabling rules and the policies that are either there or not there to protect us -- are secret or classified. We need transparency, and we need to know as Americans what the government is doing in our name so that the surveillance that takes place and the use of that information is democratically accounted for. We are all activists now, which means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance. But like in the time of Dr. Martin Luther King, there is stuff that we can do about it. So please join me, and let's get to work. Thank you. (Applause)"
11:54,Ronald Sullivan,How I help free innocent people from prison,Aug 2017,"So, imagine that you take a 19-hour, very long drive to Disney World, with two kids in the back seat. And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip, the immutable laws of nature dictate that you get the question: ""Are we there yet?"" (Laughter) So you answer this question a hundred more times, easily, in the negative, but you finally arrive. You have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful trip. You drive 19 long hours back home. And when you get there, the police are waiting on you. They accuse you of committing a crime that occurred while you were away in Florida. You tell anybody and everybody who will listen, ""I didn't do it! I couldn't have done it! I was hanging out with Mickey and Minnie and my kids!"" But no one believes you. Ultimately, you're arrested, you're tried, you're convicted and you are sentenced. And you spend 25 years in jail, until someone comes along and proves -- has the evidence to prove -- that you actually were in Florida when this crime was committed. So. So, I'm a Harvard Law professor, and the last several years, I have worked on winning the release of innocent people who've been wrongfully convicted -- people like Jonathan Fleming, who spent 24 years, eight months in jail for a murder that was committed in Brooklyn, New York, while he was in Disney World with his kids. How do we know this? Because when he was arrested, among his property in his back pocket was a receipt -- time-stamped receipt that showed that he was in Disney World. That receipt was put in the police file, a copy of it was put in the prosecutor's file, and they never gave it to his public defender. In fact, nobody even knew it was there. It just sat there for 20-some-odd years. My team looked through the file, and we found it, did the rest of the investigation, and figured out someone else committed the crime. Mr. Fleming was in Disney World, and he is now released. Let me give you a little bit of context. So about three years ago, I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney. He asked whether I'd be interested in designing a program called a ""conviction review unit."" So I said yes. A conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutor's office where prosecutors look at their past cases to determine whether or not they made mistakes. Over the course of the first year, we found about 13 wrongful convictions, people having been in jail for decades, and we released all of them. It was the most in New York history. The program is still going on, and they're up to 21 releases now -- 21 people who spent significant time behind bars. So let me tell you about a couple other of the men and women that I interacted with in the course of this program. One name is Roger Logan. Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years and wrote me a letter. It was a simple letter; it basically said, ""Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent. I've been framed. Can you look at my case?"" At first blush, the case seemed like it was open and shut, but my research had shown that single-witness identification cases are prone to error. It doesn't mean he was innocent, it just means we ought to look a little bit closer at those cases. So we did. And the facts were relatively simple. The eyewitness said she heard a shot, and she ran to the next building and turned around and looked, and there was Mr. Logan. And he was tried and convicted and in jail for 17-some-odd years. But it was a single-witness case, so we took a look at it. I sent some people to the scene, and there was an inconsistency. And to put it politely: Usain Bolt couldn't have run from where she said she was to the other spot. Right? So we knew that wasn't true. So it still didn't mean that he didn't do it, but we knew something was maybe fishy about this witness. So we looked through the file, a piece of paper in the file had a number on it. The number indicated that this witness had a record. We went back through 20 years of non-digitized papers to figure out what this record was about, and it turned out -- it turned out -- the eyewitness was in jail when she said she saw what she saw. The man spent 17 years behind bars. The last one is a case about two boys, Willie Stuckey, David McCallum. They were arrested at 15, and their conviction was vacated 29 years later. Now this was a case, once again -- first blush, it looked open and shut. They had confessed. But my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error. The DNA cases proved this several times. So we took a close look. We looked at the confession, and it turned out, there was something in the confession that those boys could not have known. The only people who knew it were police and prosecutors. We knew what really happened; someone told them to say this. We don't exactly know who, which person did, but any rate, the confession was coerced, we determined. We then went back and did forensics and did a fulsome investigation and found that two other, much older, different heights, different hairstyle, two other people committed the crime, not these two boys. I actually went to court that day, for what's called a ""vacatur hearing,"" where the conviction is thrown out. I went to court; I wanted to see Mr. McCallum walk out of there. So I went to court, and the judge said something that judges say all the time, but this took on a really special meaning. He looked up after the arguments and said, ""Mr. McCallum,"" he said five beautiful words: ""You are free to go."" Can you imagine? After just about 30 years: ""You are free to go."" And he walked out of that courtroom. Unfortunately, his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey, didn't get the benefit of that. You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison at 34 years old, and his mother sat at counsel table in his place. I'll never forget this the rest of my life. She just rocked at the table, saying, ""I knew my baby didn't do this. I knew my baby didn't do this."" And her baby didn't do this. Two other guys did it. If there's anything that we've learned, anything that I've learned, with this conviction integrity work, it's that justice doesn't happen. People make justice happen. Justice is not a thing that just descends from above and makes everything right. If it did, Mr. Stuckey wouldn't have died in prison. Justice is something that people of goodwill make happen. Justice is a decision. Justice is a decision. We make justice happen. You know, the scary thing is, in each of these three cases I described, it would have only taken just an extra minute -- an extra minute -- for someone to look through the file and find this receipt. Just one -- to look through the file, find the receipt, give it to the public defender. It would have taken someone just a minute to look at the video confession and say, ""That cannot be."" Just a minute. And perhaps Mr. Stuckey would be alive today. It reminds me of one of my favorite poems. It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays would always recite, and he called it ""God's Minute."" And it goes something like this: ""I have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it, forced upon me, can't refuse it, didn't seek it, didn't choose it. But it's up to me to use it. I must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it. Just a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it."" If I were to charge each and every one of us, I would want to say something like, ""Every day, every day, take just one extra minute and do some justice. You don't have to -- I mean, some people spend their careers and their lives, like public defenders, doing justice every day. But in your professional lives, whatever you do, take time out to just do some justice. Make a colleague feel better. If you hear something that's sexist, don't laugh, speak up. If someone is down, lift them up, one extra minute each day, and it'll be a great, great place. I want to show you something. Now, above me is a picture of David McCallum. This is the day he was released from prison. After 30 years, he got to hug a niece he had never been able to touch before. And I asked him then, I said, ""What's the first thing you want to do?"" And he said, ""I just want to walk on the sidewalk without anybody telling me where to go."" Wasn't bitter, just wanted to walk on the sidewalk. I spoke to Mr. McCallum about two weeks ago. I went to New York. It was on the two-year anniversary of his release. And we talked, we laughed, we hugged, we cried. And he's doing quite well. And one of the things he said when we met with him is that he now has dedicated his life and his career to ensuring that nobody else is locked up unjustly. Justice, my friends, is a decision. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
14:17,Noah Feldman,Hamilton vs. Madison and the birth of American partisanship,Jul 2017,"If you've been thinking about US politics and trying to make sense of it for the last year or so, you might have hit on something like the following three propositions: one, US partisanship has never been so bad before; two, for the first time, it's geographically spatialized -- we're divided between the coasts, which want to look outwards, and the center of the country, which wants to look inwards; and third, there's nothing we can do about it. I'm here to today to say that all three of these propositions, all of which sound reasonable, are not true. In fact, our US partisanship goes all the way back to the very beginning of the republic. It was geographically spatialized in almost eerily the same way that it is today, and it often has been throughout US history. And last, and by far most importantly, we actually have an extraordinary mechanism that's designed to help us manage factional disagreement and partisanship. That technology is the Constitution. And this is an evolving, subtly, supplely designed entity that has the specific purpose of teaching us how to manage factional disagreement where it's possible to do that, and giving us techniques for overcoming that disagreement when that's possible. Now, in order to tell you the story, I want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history, and that is the moment when factional disagreement and partisanship was born. There actually was a birth moment -- a moment in US history when partisanship snapped into place. The person who's at the core of that story is James Madison. And at the moment that this began, James Madison was riding high. He himself was the Einstein of not only the US Constitution, but of constitutional thought more globally, and, to give him his due, he knew it. In a period of time of just three years, from 1785 to 1788, he had conceived, theorized, designed, passed and gotten ratified the US Constitution. And just to give you some sense of the enormity of what that accomplishment actually was, although Madison couldn't have known it at the time, today that same constitutional technology that he invented is still in use not only in the US, but, 230 years later, in places like Canada, India, South Africa, Brazil. So in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world, this technology is still the dominant, most used, most effective technology to manage governance. In that moment, Madison believed that, having solved this problem, the country would run smoothly, and that he had designed a technology that would minimize the results of factions so there would be no political parties. Remarkably, he thought he had designed a constitution that was against political parties and would make them unnecessary. He had gotten an enormous degree of help in the final marketing phase of his constitutional project from a man you may have heard of, called Alexander Hamilton. Now, Hamilton was everything Madison was not. He was passionate, where Madison was restrained. He was pansexual, where Madison didn't speak to a woman except for once until he was 42 years old, and then married Dolley and lived happily ever after for 40 years. (Laughter) To put it bluntly, Hamilton's the kind of person about whom you would write a hip-hop musical -- (Laughter) and Madison is the kind of person about whom you would not write a hip-hop musical. (Laughter) Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all. But together, they had become a rather unlikely pairing, and they had produced the Federalist Papers, which offered a justification and, as I mentioned, a marketing plan for the Constitution, which had been wildly effective and wildly successful. Once the new government was in place, Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury, and he had a very specific idea in mind. And that was to do for financial institutions and infrastructure exactly what Madison had done for constitutions. Again, his contemporaries all knew it. One of them told Madison, who can't have liked it very much, that Hamilton was the Newton of infrastructure. The idea was pretty straightforward. Hamilton would give the United States a national bank, a permanent national debt -- he said it would be ""immortal,"" his phrase -- and a manufacturing policy that would enable trade and manufacturing rather than agriculture, which was where the country's primary wealth had historically been. Madison went utterly ballistic. And in this pivotal, critical decision, instead of just telling the world that his old friend Hamilton was wrong and was adopting the wrong policies, he actually began to argue that Hamilton's ideas were unconstitutional -- that they violated the very nature of the Constitution that the two of them had drafted together. Hamilton responded the way you would expect. He declared Madison to be his ""personal and political enemy"" -- these are his words. So these two founders who had been such close friends and such close allies and such partners, then began to produce enmity. And they did it in the good, old-fashioned way. First, they founded political parties. Madison created a party originally called the Democratic Republican Party -- ""Republican"" for short -- and Hamilton created a party called the Federalist Party. Those two parties adopted positions on national politics that were extreme and exaggerated. To give you a clear example: Madison, who had always believed that the country would have some manufacturing and some trade and some agriculture, began attacking Hamilton as a kind of tool of the financial markets whom Hamilton himself intended to put in charge of the country. That was an overstatement, but it was something Madison came to believe. He also attacked city life, and he said that the coasts were corrupt, and what people needed to do was to look inwards to the center of the country, to farmers, who were the essence of Republican virtue, and they should go back to the values that had made American great, specifically the values of the Revolution, and those were the values of low taxes, agriculture and less trade. Hamilton responded to this by saying that Madison was naïve, that he was childish, and that his goal was to turn the United States into a primitive autarchy, self-reliant and completely ineffectual on the global scale. (Laughter) They both meant it, and there was some truth to each of their claims, because each side was grossly exaggerating the views of the other in order to fight their war. They founded newspapers, and so for the first time in US history, the news that people received came entirely through the lens of either the Republican or the Federalist party. How does this end? Well, as it turned out, the Constitution did its work. But it did its work in surprising ways that Madison himself had not fully anticipated. First, there was a series of elections. And the first two times out of the box, the Federalists destroyed the Republicans. Madison was astonished. Of course, he blamed the press. (Laughter) And in a rather innovative view -- Madison never failed to innovate when he thought about anything -- he said the reason that the press was so pro-Federalist is that the advertisers were all Federalists, because they were traders on the coasts who got their capital from Britain, which Federalism was in bed with. That was his initial explanation. But despite the fact that the Federalists, once in power, actually enacted laws that criminalized criticism of the government -- that happened in the United States -- nevertheless, the Republicans fought back, and Madison began to emphasize the freedom of speech, which he had built into the Bill of Rights, and the capacity of civil society to organize. And sure enough, nationally, small local groups -- they were called Democratic-Republican Societies -- began to form and protest against Federalist-dominated hegemony. Eventually, the Republicans managed to win a national election -- that was in 1800. Madison became the Secretary of State, his friend and mentor Jefferson became president, and they actually, over time, managed to put the Federalists completely out of business. That was their goal. Now, why did that happen? It happened because in the structure of the Constitution were several features that actually managed faction the way there were supposed to do in the first place. What were those? One -- most important of all -- the freedom of speech. This was an innovative idea at the time. Namely, that if you were out of power, you could still say that the government was terrible. Two, civil society organization. The capacity to put together private groups, individuals, political parties and others who would organize to try to bring about fundamental change. Perhaps most significantly was the separation of powers -- an extraordinary component of the Constitution. The thing about the separation of powers is that it did then and it does now, drive governance to the center. You can get elected to office in the United States with help from the periphery, right or left. It turns out, you actually can't govern unless you bring on board the center. There are midterm elections that come incredibly fast after a presidency begins. Those drive presidents towards the center. There's a structure in which the president, in fact, does not rule or even govern, but can only propose laws which other people have to agree with -- another feature that tends to drive presidents who actually want to get things done to the center. And a glance at the newspapers today will reveal to you that these principles are still completely in operation. No matter how a president gets elected, the president cannot get anything done unless the president first of all follows the rules of the Constitution, because if not, the courts will stand up, as indeed has sometimes occurred, not only recently, but in the past, in US history. And furthermore, the president needs people, elected officials who know they need to win election from centrist voters, also to back his or her policies in order to pass laws. Without it, nothing much happens. The takeaway of this brief excursus into the history of partisanship, then, is the following: partisanship is real; it's profound; it's extraordinarily powerful, and it's terribly upsetting. But the design of the Constitution is greater than partisanship. It enables us to manage partisanship when that's possible, and it enables us actually to overcome partisan division and produce compromise, when and only when that is possible. A technology like that is a technology that worked for the founders, it worked for their grandchildren, it didn't work at the moment of the Civil War, but then it started working again. And it worked for our grandparents, our parents, and it's going to work for us. (Applause) So what you should do is really simple. Stand up for what you believe in, support the organizations that you care about, speak out on the issues that matter to you, get involved, make change, express you opinion, and do it with respect and knowledge and confidence that it's only by working together that the constitutional technology can do the job that it is designed to do. Stand up for what you believe, but take a deep breath while you do it. It's going to be OK. Thanks. (Applause)"
12:48,Anthony D. Romero,This is what democracy looks like,May 2017,"Silicon Valley is obsessed with disruption, but these days, the biggest disruptor didn't come out of Silicon Valley. It came out of steel towns in Ohio, rural communities in Pennsylvania, the Panhandle in Florida. And this last US presidential election was the mother of all disruptions. Once again, politics is personal. Millions of Americans became activists overnight, pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time. (Laughter) The election has done to family holiday dinners what Uber has done to New York City's taxi system. Couples have broken up and marriages disrupted. And the election is doing to my private life what Amazon is doing to shopping malls. These days, the ACLU is on the front lines 24/7, and even if I manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill, any cardio benefit I get is instantly obliterated when I read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll. Even my secret pleasure of studying the Italian painters have been infected by politics. Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters. This is my desk, with a postcard exhibition of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the Italian Renaissance. Now, art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly-burly of politics in my daily work at the ACLU, but not anymore. I was at the Women's March in San Francisco the day after inauguration, and the crowd was chanting, ""This is what democracy looks like."" ""This is what democracy looks like."" And there I was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain, and I flashed on an old painting that first captivated me many years ago. I struggled to remember the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government. It was almost like the old master was taunting me. You want to know what democracy looks like? Go back and look at my frescoes. And so I did. In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico. It's a painting that speaks to us, even screams to us, today. ""Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,"" Pablo Picasso once said. And as we search for the truth about government, we should keep Ambrogio's work, not a lie but an allegory, in our collective mind's eye. During Lorenzetti's time, the political legitimacy of Italian city-states was often on very shaky ground. Siena was a republic, but there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission. Siena's political leaders, who would literally govern under the eyes of these allegorical figures, were Lorenzetti's intended audience. He was cataloging the obligations of the governing to the governed. Now, you can spend years studying these frescoes. Some scholars have. I'm hardly an art historian, but I am passionate about art, and a work this massive can overwhelm me. So first, I focus on the big stuff. This is the allegory of good government. The majestic figure here in the middle is dressed in Siena's colors and he personifies the republic itself. Lorenzetti labels him ""Commune,"" and he's basically telling the Sienese that they, and not a king or a tyrant, must rule themselves. Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors. Justice is enthroned. She's looking up at the figure of wisdom, who actually supports her scales of justice. Concord, or Harmony, holds a string that comes off the scales of justice that binds her to the citizens, making them all compatriots in the republic. And finally we see Peace. She looks chilled out, like she's listening to Bob Marley. When good government rules, Peace doesn't break a sweat. Now, these are big images and big ideas, but I really love the small stuff. Along another wall, Lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details. In the countryside, the hills are landscaped and farmed. Crops are being sown, hoed, reaped, milled, plowed, all in one picture. Crops and livestock are being brought to market. In the city, builders raise a tower. People attend a law lecture, a TED Talk of the 14th century. (Laughter) Schoolchildren play. Tradesmen thrive. Dancers larger than life dance with joy. And watching over the republic is the winged figure Security, whose banner reads, ""Everyone shall go forth freely without fear."" Now, what's amazing about these images from 800 years ago is that they're familiar to us today. We see what democracy looks like. We experience the effects of good government in our lives, just as Lorenzetti did in his life. But it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since November 9. It's badly damaged, but it reads like today's newspapers. And ruling over bad government is not the Commune but the Tyrant. He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes, braided hair. He obviously spends a lot of time on that hair. (Laughter) Justice now lies helpless at his feet, shackled. Her scales have been severed. Justice is the key antagonist to the Tyrant, and she's been taken out. Now, surrounding the Tyrant, Lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government. Avarice is the old woman clutching the strongbox and a fisherman's hook to pull in her fortune. Vainglory carries a mirror, and Lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders who are guided by their own ego and vanity. On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty. Treason, half lamb, half scorpion, lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons a republic. Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat. On the Tyrant's left, you see Division. She's dressed in Siena's colors. ""Si"" and ""No"" are painted on her body. She uses a carpenter's saw to chop her body in half. And Fury wields the weapons of the mob, the stone and knife. In the remainder of the fresco, Lorenzetti shows us the inevitable effects of bad government. The civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us, and we see it. The once beautiful city has fallen to pieces, the countryside barren, the farms abandoned. Many are in flames. And in the sky above is not the winged figure Security, but that of Fear, whose banner reads: ""None shall pass along this road without fear of death."" Now, the final image, the most important one, really, is one that Lorenzetti did not paint. It is of the viewer. Today, the audience for Lorenzetti's frescoes is not the governing but the governed, the individual who stands in front of his allegories and walks away with insight, who heeds a call to action. Lorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny when they float across our political landscape, especially when those shadows are cast by political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government and promising to make America great again. And we must act. Democracy must not be a spectator sport. The right to protest, the right to assemble freely, the right to petition one's government, these are not just rights. In the face of Avarice, Fraud and Division, these are obligations. We have to disrupt -- (Applause) We have to disrupt our lives so that we can disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values. We and we the people must raise justice up and must bring peace to our nation and must come together in concord, and we have a choice. We could either paint ourselves into the worst nightmare of Lorenzetti's bad government, or we can stay in the streets, disruptive, messy, loud. That is what democracy looks like. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: First of all, wow. Obviously, many people passionately -- you spoke to many people passionately here. I'm sure there are other people here who'd say, look, Trump was elected by 63 million people. He's far from perfect, but he's trying to do what he was elected to do. Shouldn't you give him a chance? Anthony Romero: I think we have to recognize the legitimacy of him as president versus the legitimacy of his policies. And when so many of the policies are contrary to fundamental values, that we're all equal under the law, that we're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship, we have to contest those values even as we recognize and honor the fact that our democracy rendered us a president who is championing those values. CA: And the ACLU isn't just this force on the left, right? You're making other arguments as well. AR: Well, you know, very often we piss everyone off at one point. That's what we do. And we recently were taking stands for why Ann Coulter needs to be able to speak at Berkeley, and why Milo has free speech rights. And we even wrote a blog that almost burnt the house down among some of our members, unfortunately, when we talked about the fact that even Donald Trump has free speech rights as president, and an effort to hold him accountable for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies is unconstitutional and un-American. And when you put that statement out there to a very frothy base that always is very excited for you to fight Donald Trump, and then you have a new one saying, ""Wait, these rights are for everybody, even the president that we don't like."" And that's our job. (Applause) CA: Anthony, you spoke to so many of us so powerfully. Thank you so much. Thank you. (Applause)"
47:33,"Gretchen Carlson, David Brooks",Political common ground in a polarized United States,Apr 2017,"Chris Anderson: Welcome to this next edition of TED Dialogues. We're trying to do some bridging here today. You know, the American dream has inspired millions of people around the world for many years. Today, I think, you can say that America is divided, perhaps more than ever, and the divisions seem to be getting worse. It's actually really hard for people on different sides to even have a conversation. People almost feel... disgusted with each other. Some families can't even speak to each other right now. Our purpose in this dialogue today is to try to do something about that, to try to have a different kind of conversation, to do some listening, some thinking, some understanding. And I have two people with us to help us do that. They're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other. This is not like cable news. This is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life in the political center or right of the center. They've immersed themselves in conservative worldviews, if you like. They know that space very well. And we're going to explore together how to think about what is happening right now, and whether we can find new ways to bridge and just to have wiser, more connected conversations. With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson, who has spent a decade working at Fox News, hosting ""Fox and Friends"" and then ""The Real Story,"" before taking a courageous stance in filing sexual harassment claims against Roger Ailes, which eventually led to his departure from Fox News. David Brooks, who has earned the wrath of many of [The New York Times's] left-leaning readers because of his conservative views, and more recently, perhaps, some of the right-leaning readers because of his criticism of some aspects of Trump. Yet, his columns are usually the top one, two or three most-read content of the day because they're brilliant, because they bring psychology and social science to providing understanding for what's going on. So without further ado, a huge welcome to Gretchen and David. Come and join me. (Applause) So, Gretchen. Sixty-three million Americans voted for Donald Trump. Why did they do this? Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot of reasons, in my mind, why it happened. I mean, I think it was a movement of sorts, but it started long ago. It didn't just happen overnight. ""Anger"" would be the first word that I would think of -- anger with nothing being done in Washington, anger about not being heard. I think there was a huge swath of the population that feels like Washington never listens to them, you know, a good part of the middle of America, not just the coasts, and he was somebody they felt was listening to their concerns. So I think those two issues would be the main reason. I have to throw in there also celebrity. I think that had a huge impact on Donald Trump becoming president. CA: Was the anger justified? David Brooks: Yeah, I think so. In 2015 and early 2016, I wrote about 30 columns with the following theme: don't worry, Donald Trump will never be the Republican nominee. (Laughter) And having done that and gotten that so wrong, I decided to spend the ensuing year just out in Trumpworld, and I found a lot of economic dislocation. I ran into a woman in West Virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom. She said, ""The nice thing about being Catholic is we don't have to speak, and that's good, because we're not word people."" That phrase rung in my head: word people. A lot of us in the TED community are word people, but if you're not, the economy has not been angled toward you, and so 11 million men, for example, are out of the labor force because those jobs are done away. A lot of social injury. You used to be able to say, ""I'm not the richest person in the world, I'm not the most famous, but my neighbors can count on me and I get some dignity out of that."" And because of celebritification or whatever, if you're not rich or famous, you feel invisible. And a lot of moral injury, sense of feeling betrayed, and frankly, in this country, we almost have one success story, which is you go to college, get a white-collar job, and you're a success, and if you don't fit in that formula, you feel like you're not respected. And so that accumulation of things -- and when I talked to Trump voters and still do, I found most of them completely realistic about his failings, but they said, this is my shot. GC: And yet I predicted that he would be the nominee, because I've known him for 27 years. He's a master marketer, and one of the things he did extremely well that President Obama also did extremely well, was simplifying the message, simplifying down to phrases and to a populist message. Even if he can't achieve it, it sounded good. And many people latched on to that simplicity again. It's something they could grasp onto: ""I get that. I want that. That sounds fantastic."" And I remember when he used to come on my show originally, before ""The Apprentice"" was even ""The Apprentice,"" and he'd say it was the number one show on TV. I'd say back to him, ""No, it's not."" And he would say, ""Yes it is, Gretchen."" And I would say, ""No it's not."" But people at home would see that, and they'd be like, ""Wow, I should be watching the number one show on TV."" And -- lo and behold -- it became the number one show on TV. So he had this, I've seen this ability in him to be the master marketer. CA: It's puzzling to a lot of people on the left that so many women voted for him, despite some of his comments. GC: I wrote a column about this for Time Motto, saying that I really believe that lot of people put on blinders, and maybe for the first time, some people decided that policies they believed in and being heard and not being invisible anymore was more important to them than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human. And so human dignity -- whether it would be the dust-up about the disabled reporter, or what happened in that audiotape with Billy Bush and the way in which he spoke about women -- they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that, because to them, policies were more important. CA: Right, so just because someone voted for Trump, it's not blind adherence to everything that he's said or stood for. GC: No. I heard a lot of people that would say to me, ""Wow, I just wish he would shut up before the election. If he would just stay quiet, he'd get elected."" CA: And so, maybe for people on the left there's a trap there, to sort of despise or just be baffled by the support, assuming that it's for some of the unattractive features. Actually, maybe they're supporting him despite those, because they see something exciting. They see a man of action. They see the choking hold of government being thrown off in some way and they're excited by that. GC: But don't forget we saw that on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders. So this is one of the commonalities that I think we can talk about today, ""The Year of the Outsider,"" David -- right? And even though Bernie Sanders has been in Congress for a long time, he was deemed an outsider this time. And so there was anger on the left as well, and so many people were in favor of Bernie Sanders. So I see it as a commonality. People who like Trump, people who like Bernie Sanders, they were liking different policies, but the underpinning was anger. CA: David, there's often this narrative, then, that the sole explanation for Trump's victory and his rise is his tapping into anger in a very visceral way. But you've written a bit about that it's actually more than that, that there's a worldview that's being worked on here. Could you talk about that? DB: I would say he understood what, frankly, I didn't, which is what debate we were having. And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan, and it was the big government versus small government debate. It was Barry Goldwater versus George McGovern, and that was the debate we had been having for a generation. It was: Democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality, Republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom. That was the debate. He understood what I think the two major parties did not, which was that's not the debate anymore. The debate is now open versus closed. On one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization and the meritocracy blowing at their back, and they tend to favor open trade, open borders, open social mores, because there are so many opportunities. On the other side are those who feel the headwinds of globalization and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces, and they favor closed trade, closed borders, closed social mores, because they just want some security. And so he was right on that fundamental issue, and people were willing to overlook a lot to get there. And so he felt that sense of security. We're speaking the morning after Trump's joint session speech. There are three traditional groups in the Republican Party. There are the foreign policies hawks who believe in America as global policeman. Trump totally repudiated that view. Second, there was the social conservatives who believed in religious liberty, pro-life, prayer in schools. He totally ignored that. There was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue. And then there were the fiscal hawks, the people who wanted to cut down on the national debt, Tea Party, cut the size of government. He's expanding the size of government! Here's a man who has single-handedly revolutionized a major American party because he understood where the debate was headed before other people. And then guys like Steve Bannon come in and give him substance to his impulses. CA: And so take that a bit further, and maybe expand a bit more on your insights into Steve Bannon's worldview. Because he's sometimes tarred in very simple terms as this dangerous, racist, xenophobic, anger-sparking person. There's more to the story; that is perhaps an unfair simplification. DB: I think that part is true, but there's another part that's probably true, too. He's part of a global movement. It's like being around Marxists in 1917. There's him here, there's the UKIP party, there's the National Front in France, there's Putin, there's a Turkish version, a Philippine version. So we have to recognize that this is a global intellectual movement. And it believes that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility the way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do. It's held in -- the German word is the ""volk"" -- in the people, in the common, instinctive wisdom of the plain people. And the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders. And he's got a strategy for how to get there. He's got a series of policies to bring the people up and repudiate the outsiders, whether those outsiders are Islam, Mexicans, the media, the coastal elites... And there's a whole worldview there; it's a very coherent worldview. I sort of have more respect for him. I loathe what he stands for and I think he's wrong on the substance, but it's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas find a vehicle, Donald Trump, and then try to take control of the White House in order to advance his viewpoint. CA: So it's almost become, like, that the core question of our time now is: Can you be patriotic but also have a global mindset? Are these two things implacably opposed to each other? I mean, a lot of conservatives and, to the extent that it's a different category, a lot of Trump supporters, are infuriated by the coastal elites and the globalists because they see them as, sort of, not cheering for America, not embracing fully American values. I mean, have you seen that in your conversations with people, in your understanding of their mindset? GC: I do think that there's a huge difference between -- I hate to put people in categories, but, Middle America versus people who live on the coasts. It's an entirely different existence. And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have an understanding of Middle America, and I've never forgotten it. And maybe that's why I have an understanding of what happened here, because those people often feel like nobody's listening to them, and that we're only concentrating on California and New York. And so I think that was a huge reason why Trump was elected. I mean, these people felt like they were being heard. Whether or not patriotism falls into that, I'm not sure about that. I do know one thing: a lot of things Trump talked about last night are not conservative things. Had Hillary Clinton gotten up and given that speech, not one Republican would have stood up to applaud. I mean, he's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure. That is not a conservative viewpoint. He talked about government-mandated maternity leave. A lot of women may love that; it's not a conservative viewpoint. So it's fascinating that people who loved what his message was during the campaign, I'm not sure -- how do you think they'll react to that? DB: I should say I grew up in Lower Manhattan, in the triangle between ABC Carpets, the Strand Bookstore and The Odeon restaurant. (Laughter) GC: Come to Minnesota sometime! (Laughter) CA: You are a card-carrying member of the coastal elite, my man. But what did you make of the speech last night? It seemed to be a move to a more moderate position, on the face of it. DB: Yeah, I thought it was his best speech, and it took away the freakishness of him. I do think he's a moral freak, and I think he'll be undone by that fact, the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything and is uncurious about it. (Laughter) But if you take away these minor flaws, I think we got to see him at his best, and it was revealing for me to see him at his best, because to me, it exposed a central contradiction that he's got to confront, that a lot of what he's doing is offering security. So, ""I'm ordering closed borders, I'm going to secure the world for you, for my people."" But then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies, like health care reform, which is about private health care accounts, that's not security, that's risk. Educational vouchers: that's risk. Deregulation: that's risk. There's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset and a lot of the policies, which are very risk-oriented. And what I would say, especially having spent this year, the people in rural Minnesota, in New Mexico -- they've got enough risk in their lives. And so they're going to say, ""No thank you."" And I think his health care repeal will fail for that reason. CA: But despite the criticisms you just made of him, it does at least seem that he's listening to a surprisingly wide range of voices; it's not like everyone is coming from the same place. And maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion, but -- GC: I actually don't think he's listening to a wide range of voices. I think he's listening to very few people. That's just my impression of it. I believe that some of the things he said last night had Ivanka all over them. So I believe he was listening to her before that speech. And he was Teleprompter Trump last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump. And that's why, before we came out here, I said, ""We better check Twitter to see if anything's changed."" And also I think you have to keep in mind that because he's such a unique character, what was the bar that we were expecting last night? Was it here or here or here? And so he comes out and gives a looking political speech, and everyone goes, ""Wow! He can do it."" It just depends on which direction he goes. DB: Yeah, and we're trying to build bridges here, and especially for an audience that may have contempt for Trump, it's important to say, no, this is a real thing. But as I try my best to go an hour showing respect for him, my thyroid is surging, because I think the oddities of his character really are condemnatory and are going to doom him. CA: Your reputation is as a conservative. People would you describe you as right of center, and yet here you are with this visceral reaction against him and some of what he stands for. I mean, I'm -- how do you have a conversation? The people who support him, on evidence so far, are probably pretty excited. He's certainly shown real engagement in a lot of what he promised to do, and there is a strong desire to change the system radically. People hate what government has become and how it's left them out. GC: I totally agree with that, but I think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night that we used to call the bad s-word, ""stimulus,"" I find it completely ironic. To spend a trillion dollars on something -- that is not a conservative viewpoint. Then again, I don't really believe he's a Republican. DB: And I would say, as someone who identifies as conservative: first of all, to be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics. Samuel Johnson said, ""Of all the things that human hearts endure, how few are those that kings can cause and cure."" Politics is a limited realm; what matters most is the moral nature of the society. And so I have to think character comes first, and a man who doesn't pass the character threshold cannot be a good president. Second, I'm the kind of conservative who -- I harken back to Alexander Hamilton, who was a Latino hip-hop star from the heights -- (Laughter) but his definition of America was very future-oriented. He was a poor boy from the islands who had this rapid and amazing rise to success, and he wanted government to give poor boys and girls like him a chance to succeed, using limited but energetic government to create social mobility. For him and for Lincoln and for Teddy Roosevelt, the idea of America was the idea of the future. We may have division and racism and slavery in our past, but we have a common future. The definition of America that Steve Bannon stands for is backwards-looking. It's nostalgic; it's for the past. And that is not traditionally the American identity. That's traditionally, frankly, the Russian identity. That's how they define virtue. And so I think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal of what conservatism used to stand for. CA: Well, I'd like actually like to hear from you, and if we see some comments coming in from some of you, we'll -- oh, well here's one right now. Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried to convince progressive friends that they need to understand what motivates Trump supporters, yet many of them have given up trying to understand in the face of what they perceive as lies, selfishness and hatred. How would you reach out to such people, the Tea Party of the left, to try to bridge this divide? GC: I actually think there are commonalities in anger, as I expressed earlier. So I think you can come to the table, both being passionate about something. So at least you care. And I would like to believe -- the c-word has also become a horrible word -- ""compromise,"" right? So you have the far left and the far right, and compromise -- forget it. Those groups don't want to even think about it. But you have a huge swath of voters, myself included, who are registered independents, like 40 percent of us, right? So there is a huge faction of America that wants to see change and wants to see people come together. It's just that we have to figure out how to do that. CA: So let's talk about that for a minute, because we're having these TED Dialogues, we're trying to bridge. There's a lot of people out there, right now, perhaps especially on the left, who think this is a terrible idea, that actually, the only moral response to the great tyranny that may be about to emerge in America is to resist it at every stage, is to fight it tooth and nail, it's a mistake to try and do this. Just fight! Is there a case for that? DB: It depends what ""fight"" means. If it means literal fighting, then no. If it means marching, well maybe marching to raise consciousness, that seems fine. But if you want change in this country, we do it through parties and politics. We organize parties, and those parties are big, diverse, messy coalitions, and we engage in politics, and politics is always morally unsatisfying because it's always a bunch of compromises. But politics is essentially a competition between partial truths. The Trump people have a piece of the truth in America. I think Trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question, but they have some truth, and it's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the country, it's truth found in the spread of loneliness, it's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted. They peaked professionally at age 30, and it's all been downhill since. And so, understanding that doesn't take fighting, it takes conversation and then asking, ""What are we going to replace Trump with?"" GC: But you saw fighting last night, even at the speech, because you saw the Democratic women who came and wore white to honor the suffragette movement. I remember back during the campaign where some Trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment that allowed us to vote as women. It was like, what? So I don't know if that's the right way to fight. It was interesting, because I was looking in the audience, trying to see Democratic women who didn't wear white. So there's a lot going on there, and there's a lot of ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that. CA: I mean, one of the key questions, to me, is: The people who voted for Trump but, if you like, are more in the center, like they're possibly amenable to persuasion -- are they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate uprising of people saying, ""No, no, no, you can't!"" or will that actually piss them off and push them away? DB: How are any of us persuaded? Am I going to persuade you by saying, ""Well, you're kind of a bigot, you're supporting bigotry, you're supporting sexism. You're a primitive, fascistic rise from some authoritarian past""? That's probably not going to be too persuasive to you. And so the way any of us are persuaded is by: a) some basic show of respect for the point of view, and saying, ""I think this guy is not going to get you where you need to go."" And there are two phrases you've heard over and over again, wherever you go in the country. One, the phrase ""flyover country."" And that's been heard for years, but I would say this year, I heard it almost on an hourly basis, a sense of feeling invisible. And then the sense a sense of the phrase ""political correctness."" Just that rebellion: ""They're not even letting us say what we think."" And I teach at Yale. The narrowing of debate is real. CA: So you would say this is a trap that liberals have fallen into by celebrating causes they really believe in, often expressed through the language of ""political correctness."" They have done damage. They have pushed people away. DB: I would say a lot of the argument, though, with ""descent to fascism,"" ""authoritarianism"" -- that just feels over-the-top to people. And listen, I've written eight million anti-Trump columns, but it is a problem, especially for the coastal media, that every time he does something slightly wrong, we go to 11, and we're at 11 every day. And it just strains credibility at some point. CA: Crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early. But there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf. GC: But see -- one of the most important things to me is how the conservative media handles Trump. Will they call him out when things are not true, or will they just go along with it? To me, that is what is essential in this entire discussion, because when you have followers of somebody who don't really care if he tells the truth or not, that can be very dangerous. So to me, it's: How is the conservative media going to respond to it? I mean, you've been calling them out. But how will other forms of conservative media deal with that as we move forward? DB: It's all shifted, though. The conservative media used to be Fox or Charles Krauthammer or George Will. They're no longer the conservative media. Now there's another whole set of institutions further right, which is Breitbart and Infowars, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham, and so they're the ones who are now his base, not even so much Fox. CA: My last question for the time being is just on this question of the truth. I mean, it's one of the scariest things to people right now, that there is no agreement, nationally, on what is true. I've never seen anything like it, where facts are so massively disputed. Your whole newspaper, sir, is delivering fake news every day. DB: And failing. (Laughter) CA: And failing. My commiserations. But is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus, to believe the same things? Can online communities play a role here? How do we fix this? GC: See, I understand how that happened. That's another groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard, in thinking that the mainstream media was biased. There's a difference, though, between being biased and being fake. To me, that is a very important distinction in this conversation. So let's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media. OK. So there are ways to try and mend that. But what Trump's doing is nuclearizing that and saying, ""Look, we're just going to call all of that fake."" That's where it gets dangerous. CA: Do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ... Like, the principle of not supporting something that is demonstrably not true actually matters, so there will be a correction at some point? DB: I think the truth eventually comes out. So for example, Donald Trump has based a lot of his economic policy on this supposition that Americans have lost manufacturing jobs because they've been stolen by the Chinese. That is maybe 13 percent of the jobs that left. The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs were replaced by technology. That is just the truth. And so as a result, when he says, ""I'm going to close TPP and all the jobs will come roaring back,"" they will not come roaring back. So that is an actual fact, in my belief. And -- (Laughter) GC: But I'm saying what his supporters think is the truth, no matter how many times you might say that, they still believe him. DB: But eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back, and at that point, either something will work or it doesn't work, and it doesn't work or not work because of great marketing, it works because it actually addresses a real problem and so I happen to think the truth will out. CA: If you've got a question, please raise your hand here. Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box. My name's Yael Eisenstat. I hear a lot of this talk about how we all need to start talking to each other more and understanding each other more, and I've even written about this, published on this subject as well, but now today I keep hearing liberals -- yes, I live in New York, I can be considered a liberal -- we sit here and self-analyze: What did we do to not understand the Rust Belt? Or: What can we do to understand Middle America better? And what I'd like to know: Have you seen any attempts or conversations from Middle America of what can I do to understand the so-called coastal elites better? Because I'm just offended as being put in a box as a coastal elite as someone in Middle America is as being considered a flyover state and not listened to. CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook cheering as you -- (Laughter) DB: I would say -- and this is someone who has been conservative all my adult life -- when you grow up conservative, you learn to speak both languages. Because if I'm going to listen to music, I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent. So a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left. If I'm going to go to a school, I'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal. If I'm going to watch a sitcom or a late-night comedy show, it's going to be liberal. If I'm going to read a good newspaper, it'll be the New York Times. As a result, you learn to speak both languages. And that actually, at least for a number of years, when I started at National Review with William F. Buckley, it made us sharper, because we were used to arguing against people every day. The problem now that's happened is you have ghettoization on the right and you can live entirely in rightworld, so as a result, the quality of argument on the right has diminished, because you're not in the other side all the time. But I do think if you're living in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona, the coastal elites make themselves aware to you, so you know that language as well, but it's not the reverse. CA: But what does Middle America not get about coastal elites? So the critique is, you are not dealing with the real problems. There's a feeling of a snobbishness, an elitism that is very off-putting. What are they missing? If you could plant one piece of truth from the mindset of someone in this room, for example, what would you say to them? DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are. (Laughter) No, I reject the category. The problem with populism is the same problem with elitism. It's just a prejudice on the basis of probably an over-generalized  social class distinction which is too simplistic to apply in reality. Those of us in New York know there are some people in New York who are completely awesome, and some people who are pathetic, and if you live in Iowa, some people are awesome and some people are pathetic. It's not a question of what degree you have or where you happen to live in the country. The distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power. GC: But I would encourage people to watch a television news show or read a column that they normally wouldn't. So if you are a Trump supporter, watch the other side for a day, because you need to come out of the bubble if you're ever going to have a conversation. And both sides -- so if you're a liberal, then watch something that's very conservative. Read a column that is not something you would normally read, because then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking, and to me, that's a start of coming together. I worry about the same thing you worry about, these bubbles. I think if you only watch certain entities, you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about. DB: I think not only watching, being part of an organization that meets at least once a month that puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself is something we all have a responsibility for. I may get this a little wrong, but I think of the top-selling automotive models in this country, I think the top three or four are all pickup trucks. So ask yourself: How many people do I know who own a pickup truck? And it could be very few or zero for a lot of people. And that's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem. Where can I join a club where I'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck because we have a common interest in whatever? CA: And so the internet is definitely contributing to this. A question here from Chris Ajemian: ""How do you feel structure of communications, especially the prevalence of social media and individualized content, can be used to bring together a political divide, instead of just filing communities into echo chambers?"" I mean, it looks like Facebook and Google, since the election, are working hard on this question. They're trying to change the algorithms so that they don't amplify fake news to the extent that it happened last time round. Do you see any other promising signs of ...? GC: ... or amplify one side of the equation. CA: Exactly. GC: I think that was the constant argument from the right, that social media and the internet in general was putting articles towards the top that were not their worldview. I think, again, that fed into the anger. It fed into the anger of: ""You're pushing something that's not what I believe."" But social media has obviously changed everything, and I think Trump is the example of Twitter changing absolutely everything. And from his point of view, he's reaching the American people without a filter, which he believes the media is. CA: Question from the audience. Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny. I have a question regarding political correctness, and I'm curious: When did political correctness become synonymous with silencing, versus a way that we speak about other people to show them respect and preserve their dignity? GC: Well, I think the conservative media really pounded this issue for the last 10 years. I think that they really, really spent a lot of time talking about political correctness, and how people should have the ability to say what they think. Another reason why Trump became so popular: because he says what he thinks. It also makes me think about the fact that I do believe there are a lot of people in America who agree with Steve Bannon, but they would never say it publicly, and so voting for Trump gave them the opportunity to agree with it silently. DB: On the issue of immigration, it's a legitimate point of view that we have too many immigrants in the country, that it's economically costly. CA: That we have too many -- DB: Immigrants in the country, especially from Britain. (Laughter) GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK? CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry. (Laughter) I'll go now. DB: But it became sort of impermissible to say that, because it was a sign that somehow you must be a bigot of some sort. So the political correctness was not only cracking down on speech that we would all find completely offensive, it was cracking down on some speech that was legitimate, and then it was turning speech and thought into action and treating it as a crime, and people getting fired and people thrown out of schools, and there were speech codes written. Now there are these diversity teams, where if you say something that somebody finds offensive, like, ""Smoking is really dangerous,"" you can say ""You're insulting my group,"" and the team from the administration will come down into your dorm room and put thought police upon you. And so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say. And some of it is legitimate. There are certain words that there should be some social sanction against, but some of it was used to enforce a political agenda. CA: So is that a project you would urge on liberals, if you like -- progressives -- to rethink the ground rules around political correctness and accept a little more uncomfortable language in certain circumstances? Can you see that being solved to an extent that others won't be so offended? DB: I mean, most American universities, especially elite universities, are overwhelmingly on the left, and there's just an ease of temptation to use your overwhelming cultural power to try to enforce some sort of thought that you think is right and correct thought. So, be a little more self-suspicious of, are we doing that? And second, my university, the University of Chicago, sent out this letter saying, we will have no safe spaces. There will be no critique of micro-aggression. If you get your feelings hurt, well, welcome to the world of education. I do think that policy -- which is being embraced by a lot of people on the left, by the way -- is just a corrective to what's happened. CA: So here's a question from Karen Holloway: How do we foster an American culture that's forward-looking, like Hamilton, that expects and deals with change, rather than wanting to have everything go back to some fictional past? That's an easy question, right? GC: Well, I'm still a believer in the American dream, and I think what we can teach our children is the basics, which is that hard work and believing in yourself in America, you can achieve whatever you want. I was told that every single day. When I got in the real world, I was like, wow, that's maybe not always so true. But I still believe in that. Maybe I'm being too optimistic. So I still look towards the future for that to continue. DB: I think you're being too optimistic. GC: You do? DB: The odds of an American young person exceeding their parents' salary -- a generation ago, like 86 percent did it. Now 51 percent do it. There's just been a problem in social mobility in the country. CA: You've written that this entire century has basically been a disaster, that the age of sunny growth is over and we're in deep trouble. DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged, in real terms, population-adjusted, two or three percent growth for 50 years, and now we've had less than one percent growth. And so there's something seeping out. And so if I'm going to tell people that they should take risks, one of the things we're seeing is a rapid decline in mobility, the number of people who are moving across state lines, and that's especially true among millennials. It's young people that are moving less. So how do we give people the security from which they can take risk? And I'm a big believer in attachment theory of raising children, and attachment theory is based on the motto that all of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. Have you parents given you a secure base? And as a society, we do not have a secure base, and we won't get to that ""Hamilton,"" risk-taking, energetic ethos until we can supply a secure base. CA: So I wonder whether there's ground here to create almost like a shared agenda, a bridging conversation, on the one hand recognizing that there is this really deep problem that the system, the economic system that we built, seems to be misfiring right now. Second, that maybe, if you're right that it's not all about immigrants, it's probably more about technology, if you could win that argument, that de-emphasizes what seems to me the single most divisive territory between Trump supporters and others, which is around the role of the other. It's very offensive to people on the left to have the other demonized to the extent that the other seems to be demonized. That feels deeply immoral, and maybe people on the left could agree, as you said, that immigration may have happened too fast, and there is a limit beyond which human societies struggle, but nonetheless this whole problem becomes de-emphasized if automation is the key issue, and then we try to work together on recognizing that it's real, recognizing that the problem probably wasn't properly addressed or seen or heard, and try to figure out how to rebuild communities using, well, using what? That seems to me to become the fertile conversation of the future: How do we rebuild communities in this modern age, with technology doing what it's doing, and reimagine this bright future? GC: That's why I go back to optimism. I'm not being ... it's not like I'm not looking at the facts, where we've come or where we've come from. But for gosh sakes, if we don't look at it from an optimistic point of view -- I'm refusing to do that just yet. I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old to say, ""Look, the world is dim."" CA; We're going to have one more question from the room here. Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry. You both mentioned the infrastructure plan and Russia and some other things that wouldn't be traditional Republican priorities. What do you think, or when, will Republicans be motivated to take a stand against Trumpism? GC: After last night, not for a while. He changed a lot last night, I believe. DB: His popularity among Republicans -- he's got 85 percent approval, which is higher than Reagan had at this time, and that's because society has just gotten more polarized. So people follow the party much more than they used to. So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress to flake away, it's going to take a little while. GC: But also because they're all concerned about reelection, and Trump has so much power with getting people either for you or against you, and so, they're vacillating every day, probably: ""Well, should I go against or should I not?"" But last night, where he finally sounded presidential, I think most Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief today. DB: The half-life of that is short. GC: Right -- I was just going to say, until Twitter happens again. CA: OK, I want to give each of you the chance to imagine you're speaking to -- I don't know -- the people online who are watching this, who may be Trump supporters, who may be on the left, somewhere in the middle. How would you advise them to bridge or to relate to other people? Can you share any final wisdom on this? Or if you think that they shouldn't, tell them that as well. GC: I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top, just like any other organization. And I would love if, somehow, Trump supporters or people on the left could encourage their leaders to show that compassion from the top, because imagine the change that we could have if Donald Trump tweeted out today, to all of his supporters, ""Let's not be vile anymore to each other. Let's have more understanding. As a leader, I'm going to be more inclusive to all of the people of America."" To me, it starts at the top. Is he going to do that? I have no idea. But I think that everything starts from the top, and the power that he has in encouraging his supporters to have an understanding of where people are coming from on the other side. CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say I don't think we can teach each other to be civil, and give us sermons on civility. That's not going to do it. It's substance and how we act, and the nice thing about Donald Trump is he smashed our categories. All the categories that we thought we were thinking in, they're obsolete. They were great for the 20th century. They're not good for today. He's got an agenda which is about closing borders and closing trade. I just don't think it's going to work. I think if we want to rebuild communities, recreate jobs, we need a different set of agenda that smashes through all our current divisions and our current categories. For me, that agenda is Reaganism on macroeconomic policy, Sweden on welfare policy and cuts across right and left. I think we have to have a dynamic economy that creates growth. That's the Reagan on economic policy. But people have to have that secure base. There have to be nurse-family partnerships; there has to be universal preschool; there have to be charter schools; there have to be college programs with wraparound programs for parents and communities. We need to help heal the crisis of social solidarity in this country and help heal families, and government just has to get a lot more involved in the way liberals like to rebuild communities. At the other hand, we have to have an economy that's free and open the way conservatives used to like. And so getting the substance right is how you smash through the partisan identities, because the substance is what ultimately shapes our polarization. CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much for an absolutely fascinating conversation. Thank you. That was really, really interesting. (Applause) Hey, let's keep the conversation going. We're continuing to try and figure out whether we can add something here, so keep the conversation going on Facebook. Give us your thoughts from whatever part of the political spectrum you're on, and actually, wherever in the world you are. This is not just about America. It's about the world, too. But we're not going to end today without music, because if we put music in every political conversation, the world would be completely different, frankly. It just would. (Applause) Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman, Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here -- let's get a shot of her. (Applause) She created this program that brings teens together, teaches them the joy and the impact of gospel music, and hundreds of teens have gone through this program. It's transformative for them. The music they made, as you already heard, is extraordinary, and I can't think of a better way of ending this TED Dialogue than welcoming Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir from Harlem. Thank you. (Applause) (Singing) Choir: O beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain America! America! America! America! God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea From sea to shining sea (Applause)"
12:29,Brittney Cooper,The racial politics of time,Feb 2017,"What if I told you that time has a race, a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the United States? Typically, we talk about race in terms of black and white issues. In the African-American communities from which I come, we have a long-standing multi-generational joke about what we call ""CP time,"" or ""colored people's time."" Now, we no longer refer to African-Americans as ""colored,"" but this long-standing joke about our perpetual lateness to church, to cookouts, to family events and even to our own funerals, remains. I personally am a stickler for time. It's almost as if my mother, when I was growing up, said, ""We will not be those black people."" So we typically arrive to events 30 minutes early. But today, I want to talk to you more about the political nature of time, for if time had a race, it would be white. White people own time. I know, I know. Making such ""incendiary statements"" makes us uncomfortable: Haven't we moved past the point where race really matters? Isn't race a heavy-handed concept? Shouldn't we go ahead with our enlightened, progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history? How will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race? Perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule, bury them and dig them up in a thousand years, peer at them with the clearly more enlightened, raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future. But you see there, that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up in how we attempt to manage time, in the ways we narrate history, in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present into the past, in the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for is the present in which we're currently living. Now, when Barack Obama became President of the US in 2008, many Americans declared that we were post-racial. I'm from the academy where we're enamored with being post-everything. We're postmodern, we're post-structural, we're post-feminist. ""Post"" has become a simple academic appendage that we apply to a range of terms to mark the way we were. But prefixes alone don't have the power to make race and racism a thing of the past. The US was never ""pre-race."" So to claim that we're post-race when we have yet to grapple with the impact of race on black people, Latinos or the indigenous is disingenuous. Just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our post-racial future, our political conditions became the most racial they've been in the last 50 years. So today, I want to offer to you three observations, about the past, the present and the future of time, as it relates to the combating of racism and white dominance. First: the past. Time has a history, and so do black people. But we treat time as though it is timeless, as though it has always been this way, as though it doesn't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands, the genocide of indigenous people and the stealing of Africans from their homeland. When white male European philosophers first thought to conceptualize time and history, one famously declared, ""[Africa] is no historical part of the World."" He was essentially saying that Africans were people outside of history who had had no impact on time or the march of progress. This idea, that black people have had no impact on history, is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy. It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson created ""Negro History Week"" in 1926. It's the reason that we continue to celebrate Black History Month in the US every February. Now, we also see this idea that black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time or stuck in the past, in a scenario where, much as I'm doing right now, a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters, and a person, usually white, says to them, ""Why are you stuck in the past? Why can't you move on? We have a black president. We're past all that."" William Faulkner famously said, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."" But my good friend Professor Kristie Dotson says, ""Our memory is longer than our lifespan."" We carry, all of us, family and communal hopes and dreams with us. We don't have the luxury of letting go of the past. But sometimes, our political conditions are so troubling that we don't know if we're living in the past or we're living in the present. Take, for instance, when Black Lives Matter protesters go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police, and the pictures that emerge from the protest look like they could have been taken 50 years ago. The past won't let us go. But still, let us press our way into the present. At present, I would argue that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time and space. What do I mean? Well, I've already told you that white people own time. Those in power dictate the pace of the workday. They dictate how much money our time is actually worth. And Professor George Lipsitz argues that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion. They dictate how long it will actually take for minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for. Let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example. If you think about the Civil Rights Movement and the cries of its leaders for ""Freedom Now,"" they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion. By 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act was passed, there had been a full 100 years between the end of the Civil War and the conferral of voting rights on African-American communities. Despite the urgency of a war, it still took a full 100 years for actual social inclusion to occur. Since 2012, conservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts to roll back African-American voting rights by passing restrictive voter ID laws and curtailing early voting opportunities. This past July, a federal court struck down North Carolina's voter ID law saying it ""... targeted African-Americans with surgical precision."" Restricting African-American inclusion in the body politic is a primary way that we attempt to manage and control people by managing and controlling time. But another place that we see these time-space clashes is in gentrifying cities like Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Washington, DC -- places that have had black populations for generations. But now, in the name of urban renewal and progress, these communities are pushed out, in service of bringing them into the 21st century. Professor Sharon Holland asked: What happens when a person who exists in time meets someone who only occupies space? These racial struggles are battles over those who are perceived to be space-takers and those who are perceived to be world-makers. Those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world-makers who own and master time. In other words: white people. But when Hegel famously said that Africa was no historical part of the world, he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe. Africans were space-takers. So today, white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history, while too often treating black people as though we are merely taking up space to which we are not entitled. Time and the march of progress is used to justify a stunning degree of violence towards our most vulnerable populations, who, being perceived as space-takers rather than world-makers, are moved out of the places where they live, in service of bringing them into the 21st century. Shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways that time and space cohere in an unjust manner in the lives of black people. Children who are born in New Orleans zip code 70124, which is 93 percent white, can expect to live a full 25 years longer than children born in New Orleans zip code 70112, which is 60 percent black. Children born in Washington, DC's wealthy Maryland suburbs can expect to live a full 20 years longer than children born in its downtown neighborhoods. Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that, ""The defining feature of being drafted into the Black race is the inescapable robbery of time."" We experience time discrimination, he tells us, not just as structural, but as personal: in lost moments of joy, lost moments of connection, lost quality of time with loved ones and lost years of healthy quality of life. In the future, do you see black people? Do black people have a future? What if you belong to the very race of people who have always been pitted against time? What if your group is the group for whom a future was never imagined? These time-space clashes -- between protesters and police, between gentrifiers and residents -- don't paint a very pretty picture of what America hopes for black people's future. If the present is any indicator, our children will be under-educated, health maladies will take their toll and housing will continue to be unaffordable. So if we're really ready to talk about the future, perhaps we should begin by admitting that we're out of time. We black people have always been out of time. Time does not belong to us. Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency. Time is used to displace us, or conversely, we are urged into complacency through endless calls to just be patient. But if past is prologue, let us seize upon the ways in which we're always out of time anyway to demand with urgency freedom now. I believe the future is what we make it. But first, we have to decide that time belongs to all of us. No, we don't all get equal time, but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free. We can stop making your zip code the primary determinant of your lifespan. We can stop stealing learning time from black children through excessive use of suspensions and expulsions. We can stop stealing time from black people through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes. The police can stop stealing time and black lives through use of excessive force. I believe the future is what we make it. But we can't get there on colored people's time or white time or your time or even my time. It's our time. Ours. Thank you. (Applause)"
13:47,Nagin Cox,What time is it on Mars?,Feb 2017,"So many of you have probably seen the movie ""The Martian."" But for those of you who did not, it's a movie about an astronaut who is stranded on Mars, and his efforts to stay alive until the Earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to Earth. Gladly, they do re-establish communication with the character, astronaut Watney, at some point so that he's not as alone on Mars until he can be rescued. So while you're watching the movie, or even if you haven't, when you think about Mars, you're probably thinking about how far away it is and how distant. And, what might not have occurred to you is, what are the logistics really like of working on another planet -- of living on two planets when there are people on the Earth and there are rovers or people on Mars? So think about when you have friends, families and co-workers in California, on the West Coast or in other parts of the world. When you're trying to communicate with them, one of the things you probably first think about is: wait, what time is it in California? Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call? So even if you're interacting with colleagues who are in Europe, you're immediately thinking about: What does it take to coordinate communication when people are far away? So we don't have people on Mars right now, but we do have rovers. And actually right now, on Curiosity, it is 6:10 in the morning. So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars. We have four rovers on Mars. The United States has put four rovers on Mars since the mid-1990s, and I have been privileged enough to work on three of them. So, I am a spacecraft engineer, a spacecraft operations engineer, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Los Angeles, California. And these rovers are our robotic emissaries. So, they are our eyes and our ears, and they see the planet for us until we can send people. So we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers. So before we send people, we send robots. So the reason there's a time difference on Mars right now, from the time that we're at is because the Martian day is longer than the Earth day. Our Earth day is 24 hours, because that's how long it takes the Earth to rotate, how long it takes to go around once. So our day is 24 hours. It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately 40 minutes to rotate once. So that means that the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day. So teams of people who are operating the rovers on Mars, like this one, what we are doing is we are living on Earth, but working on Mars. So we have to think as if we are actually on Mars with the rover. Our job, the job of this team, of which I'm a part of, is to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day. To tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she's supposed to do. So while she's sleeping -- and the rover does sleep at night because she needs to recharge her batteries and she needs to weather the cold Martian night. And so she sleeps. So while she sleeps, we work on her program for the next day. So I work the Martian night shift. (Laughter) So in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars -- like, let's say I need to be at work at 5:00 p.m., this team needs to be at work at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day, then we have to come to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day, in order to stay in sync with Mars. That's like moving a time zone every day. So one day you come in at 8:00, the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40, the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20, the next day at 10:00. So you keep moving 40 minutes every day, until soon you're coming to work in the middle of the night -- the middle of the Earth night. Right? So you can imagine how confusing that is. Hence, the Mars watch. (Laughter) This weights in this watch have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly. Right? And we didn't start out -- I got this watch in 2004 when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then. We didn't start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches. Right? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers and on the mission control screens, and that would be enough. Yeah, not so much. Because we weren't just working on Mars time, we were actually living on Mars time. And we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was. So you really needed something on your wrist to tell you: What time is it on the Earth? What time is it on Mars? And it wasn't just the time on Mars that was confusing; we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it. So a ""sol"" is a Martian day -- again, 24 hours and 40 minutes. So when we're talking about something that's happening on the Earth, we will say, today. So, for Mars, we say, ""tosol."" (Laughter) Yesterday became ""yestersol"" for Mars. Again, we didn't start out thinking, ""Oh, let's invent a language."" It was just very confusing. I remember somebody walked up to me and said, ""I would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."" And I said, ""Tomorrow, tomorrow, or Mars, tomorrow?"" We started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other. (Laughter) Tomorrow became ""nextersol"" or ""solorrow."" Because people have different preferences for the words they use. Some of you might say ""soda"" and some of you might say ""pop."" So we have people who say ""nextersol"" or ""solorrow."" And then something that I noticed after a few years of working on these missions, was that the people who work on the rovers, we say ""tosol."" The people who work on the landed missions that don't rove around, they say ""tosoul."" So I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent. (Laughter) So we have the watches and the language, and you're detecting a theme here, right? So that we don't get confused. But even the Earth daylight could confuse us. If you think that right now, you've come to work and it's the middle of the Martian night and there's light streaming in from the windows that's going to be confusing as well. So you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down. So that there's no light to distract us. The blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing, and they didn't go up until we went off Mars time. So this also works for the house, for at home. I've been on Mars time three times, and my husband is like, OK, we're getting ready for Mars time. And so he'll put foil all over the windows and dark curtains and shades because it also affects your families. And so here I was living in kind of this darkened environment, but so was he. And he'd gotten used to it. But then I would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work. Should I come home? Are you awake? What time is it on Mars? And I decided, OK, so he needs a Mars watch. (Laughter) But of course, it's 2016, so there's an app for that. (Laughter) So now instead of the watches, we can also use our phones. But the impact on families was just across the board; it wasn't just those of us who were working on the rovers but our families as well. This is David Oh, one of our flight directors, and he's at the beach in Los Angeles with his family at 1:00 in the morning. (Laughter) So because we landed in August and his kids didn't have to go back to school until September, they actually went on to Mars time with him for one month. They got up 40 minutes later every day. And they were on dad's work schedule. So they lived on Mars time for a month and had these great adventures, like going bowling in the middle of the night or going to the beach. And one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles at 3:00 in the morning when there's no traffic. (Laughter) So we would get off work, and we didn't want to go home and bother our families, and we were hungry, so instead of going locally to eat something, we'd go, ""Wait, there's this great all-night deli in Long Beach, and we can get there in 10 minutes!"" So we would drive down -- it was like the 60s, no traffic. We would drive down there, and the restaurant owners would go, ""Who are you people? And why are you at my restaurant at 3:00 in the morning?"" So they came to realize that there were these packs of Martians, roaming the LA freeways, in the middle of the night -- in the middle of the Earth night. And we did actually start calling ourselves Martians. So those of us who were on Mars time would refer to ourselves as Martians, and everyone else as Earthlings. (Laughter) And that's because when you're moving a time-zone every day, you start to really feel separated from everyone else. You're literally in your own world. So I have this button on that says, ""I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."" And there's a picture of it up on the screen. So the reason we got these buttons is because we work on Mars time in order to be as efficient as possible with the rover on Mars, to make the best use of our time. But we don't stay on Mars time for more than three to four months. Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars time, which is what we're working now. And that's because it's hard on your bodies, it's hard on your families. In fact, there were sleep researchers who actually were studying us because it was so unusual for humans to try to extend their day. And they had about 30 of us that they would do sleep deprivation experiments on. So I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one. And that was because, again, this eventually becomes hard on your body. Even though it was a blast. It was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team, but it is difficult to sustain. So these rover missions are our first steps out into the solar system. We are learning how to live on more than one planet. We are changing our perspective to become multi-planetary. So the next time you see a Star Wars movie, and there are people going from the Dagobah system to Tatooine, think about what it really means to have people spread out so far. What it means in terms of the distances between them, how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time. We have not sent people to Mars yet, but we hope to. And between companies like SpaceX and NASA and all of the international space agencies of the world, we hope to do that in the next few decades. So soon we will have people on Mars, and we truly will be multi-planetary. And the young boy or the young girl who will be going to Mars could be in this audience or listening today. I have wanted to work at JPL on these missions since I was 14 years old and I am privileged to be a part of it. And this is a remarkable time in the space program, and we are all in this journey together. So the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day, just remember, it's all a matter of your Earthly perspective. Thank you. (Applause)"
15:18,Sue Klebold,My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story,Feb 2017,"The last time I heard my son's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school. He called out one word in the darkness: ""Bye."" It was April 20, 1999. Later that morning, at Columbine High School, my son Dylan and his friend Eric killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives. Thirteen innocent people were killed, leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma. Others sustained injuries, some resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability. But the enormity of the tragedy can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place. There's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school, or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts. There's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine, especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own. Columbine was a tidal wave, and when the crash ended, it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact. It has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy. The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew. Afterwards people asked, ""How could you not know? What kind of a mother were you?"" I still ask myself those same questions. Before the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom. Helping my children become caring, healthy, responsible adults was the most important role of my life. But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent, and it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today. Aside from his father, I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most. If anyone could have known what was happening, it should have been me, right? But I didn't know. Today, I'm here to share the experience of what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts. For years after the tragedy, I combed through memories, trying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent. But there are no simple answers. I can't give you any solutions. All I can do is share what I have learned. When I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings, I have three challenges to meet. First, when I walk into a room like this, I never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did. I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn't here to do it for himself. So first, with all of my heart, I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain. The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my son's death as a suicide. Two years before he died, he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself. He said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life. I didn't know about any of this until months after his death. When I talk about his death as a suicide, I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life. I'm trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder. After a lot of reading and talking with experts, I have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill but in his desire to die. The third challenge I have when I talk about my son's murder-suicide is that I'm talking about mental health -- excuse me -- is that I'm talking about mental health, or brain health, as I prefer to call it, because it's more concrete. And in the same breath, I'm talking about violence. The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness. Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people, but of those who die by suicide, it's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind. As you all know very well, our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone, and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria for a specific diagnosis. Many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated. Too often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis. If estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person, when suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations, the murder-suicide rates will rise as well. I wanted to understand what was going on in Dylan's mind prior to his death, so I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss. I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events, and whenever I could, I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt. One of the most helpful conversations I had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle. She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did. Later, when she found me alone, she apologized for overhearing that conversation, but told me that I was wrong. She said that when she was a young, single mother with three small children, she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe. At the time, she was certain that her children would be better off if she died, so she had made a plan to end her life. She assured me that a mother's love was the strongest bond on Earth, and that she loved her children more than anything in the world, but because of her illness, she was sure that they would be better off without her. What she said and what I've learned from others is that we do not make the so-called decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to drive or where to go on a Saturday night. When someone is in an extremely suicidal state, they are in a stage four medical health emergency. Their thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance. Even though they can make a plan and act with logic, their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality. Some people can be very good at hiding this state, and they often have good reasons for doing that. Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point, but persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology, and like many illnesses, the condition has to be recognized and treated before a life is lost. But my son's death was not purely a suicide. It involved mass murder. I wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal. But research is sparse and there are no simple answers. Yes, he probably had ongoing depression. He had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant, and that made him less likely to seek help from others. He had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad. And he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation, and who was seriously disturbed, controlling and homicidal. And on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility, Dylan found access to guns even though we'd never owned any in our home. It was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns, both legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge. And somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later, it's still appallingly easy. What Dylan did that day broke my heart, and as trauma so often does, it took a toll on my body and on my mind. Two years after the shootings, I got breast cancer, and two years after that, I began to have mental health problems. On top of the constant, perpetual grief I was terrified that I would run into a family member of someone Dylan had killed, or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen. I was afraid to turn on the news, afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person. I started having panic attacks. The first bout started four years after the shootings, when I was getting ready for the depositions and would have to meet the victims' families face to face. The second round started six years after the shootings, when I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide for the first time at a conference. Both episodes lasted several weeks. The attacks happened everywhere: in the hardware store, in my office, or even while reading a book in bed. My mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how I hard I tried to calm myself down or reason my way out of it, I couldn't do it. It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me, and then, being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts. That's when I learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind, and that's when I truly became a brain health advocate. With therapy and medication and self-care, life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances. When I looked back on all that had happened, I could see that my son's spiral into dysfunction probably occurred over a period of about two years, plenty of time to get him help, if only someone had known that he needed help and known what to do. Every time someone asks me, ""How could you not have known?"", it feels like a punch in the gut. It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy I've had I will never fully eradicate. But here's something I've learned: if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves, suicides would hardly ever happen. But love is not enough, and suicide is prevalent. It's the second leading cause of death for people age 10 to 34, and 15 percent of American youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year. I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel, and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else, can cause us to miss what's hidden in plain sight. And if worst case scenarios do come to pass, we'll have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing or for not asking the right questions or not finding the right treatment. We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering, regardless of what they say or how they act. We should listen with our whole being, without judgments, and without offering solutions. I know that I will live with this tragedy, with these multiple tragedies, for the rest of my life. I know that in the minds of many, what I lost can't compare to what the other families lost. I know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier. I know there are even some who think I don't have the right to any pain, but only to a life of permanent penance. In the end what I know comes down to this: the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help, but for love's sake, we must never stop trying to know the unknowable. Thank you. (Applause)"
4:10,Peter Paccone,How do US Supreme Court justices get appointed?,Nov 2016,"There's a job out there with a great deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become  a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court  in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age, education, profession, or even native-born  citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual to serve. So far, six justices  have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint  liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower, a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that appointment as ""the biggest damned-fool mistake""  he ever made. Many other factors come up for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties, ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews  the candidate and makes a formal nomination announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration, these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed  about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send the nomination to the full Senate with a positive  or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings, or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened when the Senate majority has been a different political  party than the president. When the Senate does approve, it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues  a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete the final steps to take the constitutional  and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer  justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme  Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, ""a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard."" Of course, not every member of the Court turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected by the ultimate judges, time and history."
20:17,Jonathan Haidt,Can a divided America heal?,Nov 2016,"Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary. Jonathan Haidt: Yeah. CA: It feels like the world is in a place that we haven't seen for a long time. People don't just disagree in the way that we're familiar with, on the left-right political divide. There are much deeper differences afoot. What on earth is going on, and how did we get here? JH: This is different. There's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling. Survey research by Pew Research shows that the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just -- we don't just dislike them; we strongly dislike them, and we think that they are a threat to the nation. Those numbers have been going up and up, and those are over 50 percent now on both sides. People are scared, because it feels like this is different than before; it's much more intense. Whenever I look at any sort of social puzzle, I always apply the three basic principles of moral psychology, and I think they'll help us here. So the first thing that you have to always keep in mind when you're thinking about politics is that we're tribal. We evolved for tribalism. One of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature is the Bedouin proverb: ""Me against my brother; me and my brother against our cousin; me and my brother and cousins against the stranger."" And that tribalism allowed us to create large societies and to come together in order to compete with others. That brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups, but it means that we have eternal conflict. The question you have to look at is: What aspects of our society are making that more bitter, and what are calming them down? CA: That's a very dark proverb. You're saying that that's actually baked into most people's mental wiring at some level? JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just a basic aspect of human social cognition. But we can also live together really peacefully, and we've invented all kinds of fun ways of, like, playing war. I mean, sports, politics -- these are all ways that we get to exercise this tribal nature without actually hurting anyone. We're also really good at trade and exploration and meeting new people. So you have to see our tribalism as something that goes up or down -- it's not like we're doomed to always be fighting each other, but we'll never have world peace. CA: The size of that tribe can shrink or expand. JH: Right. CA: The size of what we consider ""us"" and what we consider ""other"" or ""them"" can change. And some people believed that process could continue indefinitely. JH: That's right. CA: And we were indeed expanding the sense of tribe for a while. JH: So this is, I think, where we're getting at what's possibly the new left-right distinction. I mean, the left-right as we've all inherited it, comes out of the labor versus capital distinction, and the working class, and Marx. But I think what we're seeing now, increasingly, is a divide in all the Western democracies between the people who want to stop at nation, the people who are more parochial -- and I don't mean that in a bad way -- people who have much more of a sense of being rooted, they care about their town, their community and their nation. And then those who are anti-parochial and who -- whenever I get confused, I just think of the John Lennon song ""Imagine."" ""Imagine there's no countries, nothing to kill or die for."" And so these are the people who want more global governance, they don't like nation states, they don't like borders. You see this all over Europe as well. There's a great metaphor guy -- actually, his name is Shakespeare -- writing ten years ago in Britain. He had a metaphor: ""Are we drawbridge-uppers or drawbridge-downers?"" And Britain is divided 52-48 on that point. And America is divided on that point, too. CA: And so, those of us who grew up with The Beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world -- it felt so idealistic and ""how could anyone think badly about that?"" And what you're saying is that, actually, millions of people today feel that that isn't just silly; it's actually dangerous and wrong, and they're scared of it. JH: I think the big issue, especially in Europe but also here, is the issue of immigration. And I think this is where we have to look very carefully at the social science about diversity and immigration. Once something becomes politicized, once it becomes something that the left loves and the right -- then even the social scientists can't think straight about it. Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways. It clearly creates more innovation. The American economy has grown enormously from it. Diversity and immigration do a lot of good things. But what the globalists, I think, don't see, what they don't want to see, is that ethnic diversity cuts social capital and trust. There's a very important study by Robert Putnam, the author of ""Bowling Alone,"" looking at social capital databases. And basically, the more people feel that they are the same, the more they trust each other, the more they can have a redistributionist welfare state. Scandinavian countries are so wonderful because they have this legacy of being small, homogenous countries. And that leads to a progressive welfare state, a set of progressive left-leaning values, which says, ""Drawbridge down! The world is a great place. People in Syria are suffering -- we must welcome them in."" And it's a beautiful thing. But if, and I was in Sweden this summer, if the discourse in Sweden is fairly politically correct and they can't talk about the downsides, you end up bringing a lot of people in. That's going to cut social capital, it makes it hard to have a welfare state and they might end up, as we have in America, with a racially divided, visibly racially divided, society. So this is all very uncomfortable to talk about. But I think this is the thing, especially in Europe and for us, too, we need to be looking at. CA: You're saying that people of reason, people who would consider themselves not racists, but moral, upstanding people, have a rationale that says humans are just too different; that we're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of, by mixing in people who are too different. JH: Yes, but I can make it much more palatable by saying it's not necessarily about race. It's about culture. There's wonderful work by a political scientist named Karen Stenner, who shows that when people have a sense that we are all united, we're all the same, there are many people who have a predisposition to authoritarianism. Those people aren't particularly racist when they feel as through there's not a threat to our social and moral order. But if you prime them experimentally by thinking we're coming apart, people are getting more different, then they get more racist, homophobic, they want to kick out the deviants. So it's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction. The left, following through the Lennonist line -- the John Lennon line -- does things that create an authoritarian reaction. We're certainly seeing that in America with the alt-right. We saw it in Britain, we've seen it all over Europe. But the more positive part of that is that I think the localists, or the nationalists, are actually right -- that, if you emphasize our cultural similarity, then race doesn't actually matter very much. So an assimilationist approach to immigration removes a lot of these problems. And if you value having a generous welfare state, you've got to emphasize that we're all the same. CA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that are one of the causes of the current divide. What are other causes? JH: The next principle of moral psychology is that intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. You've probably heard the term ""motivated reasoning"" or ""confirmation bias."" There's some really interesting work on how our high intelligence and our verbal abilities might have evolved not to help us find out the truth, but to help us manipulate each other, defend our reputation ... We're really, really good at justifying ourselves. And when you bring group interests into account, so it's not just me, it's my team versus your team, whereas if you're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong, we just can't accept that. So this is why you can't win a political argument. If you're debating something, you can't persuade the person with reasons and evidence, because that's not the way reasoning works. So now, give us the internet, give us Google: ""I heard that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Let me Google that -- oh my God! 10 million hits! Look, he was!"" CA: So this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people. Social media has often been framed by techno-optimists as this great connecting force that would bring people together. And there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that. JH: That's right. That's why I'm very enamored of yin-yang views of human nature and left-right -- that each side is right about certain things, but then it goes blind to other things. And so the left generally believes that human nature is good: bring people together, knock down the walls and all will be well. The right -- social conservatives, not libertarians -- social conservatives generally believe people can be greedy and sexual and selfish, and we need regulation, and we need restrictions. So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls, allow people to communicate all over the world, you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism. CA: So help us understand. These principles of human nature have been with us forever. What's changed that's deepened this feeling of division? JH: You have to see six to ten different threads all coming together. I'll just list a couple of them. So in America, one of the big -- actually, America and Europe -- one of the biggest ones is World War II. There's interesting research from Joe Henrich and others that says if your country was at war, especially when you were young, then we test you 30 years later in a commons dilemma or a prisoner's dilemma, you're more cooperative. Because of our tribal nature, if you're -- my parents were teenagers during World War II, and they would go out looking for scraps of aluminum to help the war effort. I mean, everybody pulled together. And so then these people go on, they rise up through business and government, they take leadership positions. They're really good at compromise and cooperation. They all retire by the '90s. So we're left with baby boomers by the end of the '90s. And their youth was spent fighting each other within each country, in 1968 and afterwards. The loss of the World War II generation, ""The Greatest Generation,"" is huge. So that's one. Another, in America, is the purification of the two parties. There used to be liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. So America had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan. But because of a variety of factors that started things moving, by the 90's, we had a purified liberal party and conservative party. So now, the people in either party really are different, and we really don't want our children to marry them, which, in the '60s, didn't matter very much. So, the purification of the parties. Third is the internet and, as I said, it's just the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization. CA: The tone of what's happening on the internet now is quite troubling. I just did a quick search on Twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other. One, against a picture of racist graffiti: ""This is disgusting! Ugliness in this country, brought to us by #Trump."" And then the next one is: ""Crooked Hillary dedication page. Disgusting!"" So this idea of ""disgust"" is troubling to me. Because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something, you can get angry at someone. Disgust, I've heard you say, takes things to a much deeper level. JH: That's right. Disgust is different. Anger -- you know, I have kids. They fight 10 times a day, and they love each other 30 times a day. You just go back and forth: you get angry, you're not angry; you're angry, you're not angry. But disgust is different. Disgust paints the person as subhuman, monstrous, deformed, morally deformed. Disgust is like indelible ink. There's research from John Gottman on marital therapy. If you look at the faces -- if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt, that's a predictor that they're going to get divorced soon, whereas if they show anger, that doesn't predict anything, because if you deal with anger well, it actually is good. So this election is different. Donald Trump personally uses the word ""disgust"" a lot. He's very germ-sensitive, so disgust does matter a lot -- more for him, that's something unique to him -- but as we demonize each other more, and again, through the Manichaean worldview, the idea that the world is a battle between good and evil as this has been ramping up, we're more likely not just to say they're wrong or I don't like them, but we say they're evil, they're satanic, they're disgusting, they're revolting. And then we want nothing to do with them. And that's why I think we're seeing it, for example, on campus now. We're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus, silence them, keep them away. I'm afraid that this whole generation of young people, if their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust, they're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older. CA: So how do we deal with that? Disgust. How do you defuse disgust? JH: You can't do it with reasons. I think ... I studied disgust for many years, and I think about emotions a lot. And I think that the opposite of disgust is actually love. Love is all about, like ... Disgust is closing off, borders. Love is about dissolving walls. So personal relationships, I think, are probably the most powerful means we have. You can be disgusted by a group of people, but then you meet a particular person and you genuinely discover that they're lovely. And then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well. The tragedy is, Americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns by left-right or politics. And now that it's become this great moral divide, there's a lot of evidence that we're moving to be near people who are like us politically. It's harder to find somebody who's on the other side. So they're over there, they're far away. It's harder to get to know them. CA: What would you say to someone or say to Americans, people generally, about what we should understand about each other that might help us rethink for a minute this ""disgust"" instinct? JH: Yes. A really important thing to keep in mind -- there's research by political scientist Alan Abramowitz, showing that American democracy is increasingly governed by what's called ""negative partisanship."" That means you think, OK there's a candidate, you like the candidate, you vote for the candidate. But with the rise of negative advertising and social media and all sorts of other trends, increasingly, the way elections are done is that each side tries to make the other side so horrible, so awful, that you'll vote for my guy by default. And so as we more and more vote against the other side and not for our side, you have to keep in mind that if people are on the left, they think, ""Well, I used to think that Republicans were bad, but now Donald Trump proves it. And now every Republican, I can paint with all the things that I think about Trump."" And that's not necessarily true. They're generally not very happy with their candidate. This is the most negative partisanship election in American history. So you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate from your feelings about the people who are given a choice. And then you have to realize that, because we all live in a separate moral world -- the metaphor I use in the book is that we're all trapped in ""The Matrix,"" or each moral community is a matrix, a consensual hallucination. And so if you're within the blue matrix, everything's completely compelling that the other side -- they're troglodytes, they're racists, they're the worst people in the world, and you have all the facts to back that up. But somebody in the next house from yours is living in a different moral matrix. They live in a different video game, and they see a completely different set of facts. And each one sees different threats to the country. And what I've found from being in the middle and trying to understand both sides is: both sides are right. There are a lot of threats to this country, and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all. CA: So, are you saying that we almost need a new type of empathy? Empathy is traditionally framed as: ""Oh, I feel your pain. I can put myself in your shoes."" And we apply it to the poor, the needy, the suffering. We don't usually apply it to people who we feel as other, or we're disgusted by. JH: No. That's right. CA: What would it look like to build that type of empathy? JH: Actually, I think ... Empathy is a very, very hot topic in psychology, and it's a very popular word on the left in particular. Empathy is a good thing, and empathy for the preferred classes of victims. So it's important to empathize with the groups that we on the left think are so important. That's easy to do, because you get points for that. But empathy really should get you points if you do it when it's hard to do. And, I think ... You know, we had a long 50-year period of dealing with our race problems and legal discrimination, and that was our top priority for a long time and it still is important. But I think this year, I'm hoping it will make people see that we have an existential threat on our hands. Our left-right divide, I believe, is by far the most important divide we face. We still have issues about race and gender and LGBT, but this is the urgent need of the next 50 years, and things aren't going to get better on their own. So we're going to need to do a lot of institutional reforms, and we could talk about that, but that's like a whole long, wonky conversation. But I think it starts with people realizing that this is a turning point. And yes, we need a new kind of empathy. We need to realize: this is what our country needs, and this is what you need if you don't want to -- Raise your hand if you want to spend the next four years as angry and worried as you've been for the last year -- raise your hand. So if you want to escape from this, read Buddha, read Jesus, read Marcus Aurelius. They have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear, reframe things, stop seeing other people as your enemy. There's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy. CA: Here's my last question: Personally, what can people do to help heal? JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices. And there's research showing that political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices in the country now. So I think you have to make an effort -- that's the main thing. Make an effort to actually meet somebody. Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law, somebody who's on the other side. So, after this election -- wait a week or two, because it's probably going to feel awful for one of you -- but wait a couple weeks, and then reach out and say you want to talk. And before you do it, read Dale Carnegie, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" -- (Laughter) I'm totally serious. You'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging, if you start by saying, ""You know, we don't agree on a lot, but one thing I really respect about you, Uncle Bob,"" or ""... about you conservatives, is ... "" And you can find something. If you start with some appreciation, it's like magic. This is one of the main things I've learned that I take into my human relationships. I still make lots of stupid mistakes, but I'm incredibly good at apologizing now, and at acknowledging what somebody was right about. And if you do that, then the conversation goes really well, and it's actually really fun. CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating speaking with you. It really does feel like the ground that we're on is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature. Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant. Thank you so much for sharing this time with us. JH: Thanks, Chris. JH: Thanks, everyone. (Applause)"
13:50,Kandice Sumner,How America's public schools keep kids in poverty,Nov 2016,"I want to talk to you about my kids. Now, I know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic, the most beautiful kid that ever lived. But mine really are. (Laughter) I have 696 kids, and they are the most intelligent, inventive, innovative, brilliant and powerful kids that you'll ever meet. Any student I've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid. However, because their ""real"" parents aren't rich and, I argue, because they are mostly of color, they will seldom get to see in themselves the awesomeness that I see in them. Because what I see in them is myself -- or what would have been myself. I am the daughter of two hardworking, college-educated, African-American parents who chose careers as public servants: my father, a minister; my mother, an educator. Wealth was never the primary ambition in our house. Because of this lack of wealth, we lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth, and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth. Luckily, however, we struck the educational jackpot in a voluntary desegregation program that buses inner-city kids -- black and brown -- out to suburban schools -- rich and white. At five years old, I had to take an hour-long bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education. At five years old, I thought everyone had a life just like mine. I thought everyone went to school and were the only ones using the brown crayons to color in their family portraits, while everyone else was using the peach-colored ones. At five years old, I thought everyone was just like me. But as I got older, I started noticing things, like: How come my neighborhood friend don't have to wake up at five o'clock in the morning, and go to a school that's an hour away? How come I'm learning to play the violin while my neighborhood friends don't even have a music class? Why were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material that I had done two to three years prior? See, as I got older, I started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly, like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to be doing; taking something that wasn't mine; receiving a gift, but with someone else's name on it. All these amazing things that I was being exposed to and experiencing, I felt I wasn't really supposed to have. I wasn't supposed to have a library, fully equipped athletic facilities, or safe fields to play in. I wasn't supposed to have theatre departments with seasonal plays and concerts -- digital, visual, performing arts. I wasn't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs, school buses that brought me door-to-door, freshly prepared school lunches or even air conditioning. These are things my kids don't get. You see, as I got older, while I was grateful for this amazing opportunity that I was being given, there was this ever-present pang of: But what about everyone else? There are thousands of other kids just like me, who deserve this, too. Why doesn't everyone get this? Why is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich? It was like I had some sort of survivor's remorse. All of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that I was saved from through a bus ride. I was like an educational Moses screaming, ""Let my people go ... to high-quality schools!"" (Laughter) I'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated. I'd seen the educational promised land, and I could not for the life of me justify the disparity. I now teach in the very same school system from which I sought refuge. I know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student, and now as a teacher, I don't have access to those same tools to give my students. There have been countless nights when I've cried in frustration, anger and sorrow, because I can't teach my kids the way that I was taught, because I don't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me. My kids deserve so much better. We sit and we keep banging our heads against this term: ""Achievement gap, achievement gap!"" Is it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids don't? I mean, really. I think we've got it all wrong. I think we, as Gloria Ladson-Billings says, should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is. It's not an achievement gap; it's an education debt, for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested in the education of the black and brown child over time. A little-known secret in American history is that the only American institution created specifically for people of color is the American slave trade -- and some would argue the prison system, but that's another topic for another TED Talk. (Laughter) The public school system of this country was built, bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor. While African-Americans were enslaved and prohibited from schooling, their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded. Ever since then, every court case, educational policy, reform, has been an attempt to retrofit the design, rather than just stopping and acknowledging: we've had it all wrong from the beginning. An oversimplification of American educational history. All right, just bear with me. Blacks were kept out -- you know, the whole slavery thing. With the help of philanthropic white people, they built their own schools. Separate but equal was OK. But while we all know things were indeed separate, they were in no ways equal. Enter Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954; legal separation of the races is now illegal. But very few people pay attention to all of the court cases since then, that have undone the educational promised land for every child that Brown v. Board intended. Some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place. Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine, the Civil Rights Movement, is a real awkward moment in my classroom, when I have to hear the voice of a child ask, ""If schools were desegregated in 1954, how come there are no white kids here?"" (Laughter) These kids aren't dumb. They know exactly what's happening, and what's not. They know that when it comes to schooling, black lives don't matter and they never have. For years, I tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading. I'd amassed a modest classroom library of books I'd accumulated from secondhand shops, thrift stores, attics -- you know. But whenever I said those dreadful words, ""Take out a book and read,"" you'd think I'd just declared war. It was torture. One day, after I'd heard about this website called DonorsChoose, where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom and anonymous donors fulfill them, I figured I'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list of the teenager's dream library. Over 200 brand-new books were sent to my room piece by piece. Every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee, ""This feels like Christmas!"" (Laughter) Then they'd say, ""Ms. Sumner, where did these books come from?"" And then I'd reply, ""Strangers from all over the country wanted you to have these."" And then they'd say, almost suspiciously, ""But they're brand-new."" (Laughter) To which I'd reply, ""You deserve brand-new books."" The whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls, as she peeled open a crisp paperback said, ""Ms. Sumner -- you know, I figured you bought these books, 'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff. But to know that a stranger, someone I don't even know, cares this much about me is pretty cool."" Knowing that strangers will take care of you is a privilege my kids aren't afforded. Ever since the donation, there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home, and then returning them with the exclamation, ""This one was good!"" (Laughter) Now when I say, ""Take out a book and read,"" kids rush to my library. It wasn't that they didn't want to read, but instead, they'd gladly read if the resources were there. Institutionally speaking, our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child. We keep focusing on the end results or test results, and getting frustrated. We get to a catastrophe and we wonder, ""How did it get so bad? How did we get here?"" Really? If you neglect a child long enough, you no longer have the right to be surprised when things don't turn out well. Stop being perplexed or confused or befuddled by the achievement gap, the income gap, the incarceration rates, or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new ""it"" term for the moment. The problems we have as a country are the problems we created as a country. The quality of your education is directly proportionate to your access to college, your access to jobs, your access to the future. Until we live in a world where every kid can get a high-quality education no matter where they live, or the color of their skin, there are things we can do on a macro level. School funding should not be decided by property taxes or some funky economic equation where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid, while poor kids are continuously having food and resources taken from their mouths. Governors, senators, mayors, city council members -- if we're going to call public education public education, then it should be just that. Otherwise, we should call it what it really is: poverty insurance. ""Public education: keeping poor kids poor since 1954."" (Laughter) If we really, as a country, believe that education is the ""great equalizer,"" then it should be just that: equal and equitable. Until then, there's no democracy in our democratic education. On a mezzo level: historically speaking, the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others. And unfortunately, today it still does. If your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little Timmy down the street goes to an affluent school, challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom. Close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter. When resources are shared, they're not divided; they're multiplied. And on a micro level: if you're a human being, donate. Time, money, resources, opportunities -- whatever is in your heart. There are websites like DonorsChoose that recognize the disparity and actually want to do something about it. What is a carpenter with no tools? What is an actress with no stage? What is a scientist with no laboratory? What is a doctor with no equipment? I'll tell you: they're my kids. Shouldn't they be your kids, too? Thank you. (Applause)"
15:37,Ian Bremmer,How the US should use its superpower status,Oct 2016,"When you come to TEDx, you always think about technology, the world changing, becoming more innovative. You think about the driverless. Everyone's talking about driverless cars these days, and I love the concept of a driverless car, but when I go in one, you know, I want it really slow, I want access to the steering wheel and the brake, just in case. I don't know about you, but I am not ready for a driverless bus. I am not ready for a driverless airplane. How about a driverless world? And I ask you that because we are increasingly in one. It's not supposed to be that way. We're number one, the United States is large and in charge. Americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing. Right? Whether it's the World Trade Organization or it's the IMF, the World Bank, the Bretton Woods Accord on currency, these were American institutions, our values, our friends, our allies, our money, our standards. That was the way the world worked. So it's sort of interesting, if you want to look at how the US looks, here it is. This is our view of how the world is run. President Obama has got the red carpet, he goes down Air Force One, and it feels pretty good, it feels pretty comfortable. Well, I don't know how many of you saw the China trip last week and the G20. Oh my God. Right? This is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world's leaders in China. The National Security Advisor was actually spewing expletives on the tarmac -- no red carpet, kind of left out the bottom of the plane along with all the media and everybody else. Later on in the G20, well, there's Obama. (Laughter) Hi, George. Hi, Norman. They look like they're about to get into a cage match, right? And they did. It was 90 minutes long, and they talked about Syria. That's what Putin wanted to talk about. He's increasingly calling the shots. He's the one willing to do stuff there. There's not a lot of mutual like or trust, but it's not as if the Americans are telling him what to do. How about when the whole 20 are getting together? Surely, when the leaders are all onstage, then the Americans are pulling their weight. Uh-oh. (Laughter) Xi Jinping seems fine. Angela Merkel has -- she always does -- that look, she always does that. But Putin is telling Turkish president Erdogan what to do, and Obama is like, what's going on over there? You see. And the problem is it's not a G20, the problem is it's a G-Zero world that we live in, a world order where there is no single country or alliance that can meet the challenges of global leadership. The G20 doesn't work, the G7, all of our friends, that's history. So globalization is continuing. Goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before, but Americanization is not. So if I've convinced you of that, I want to do two things with the rest of this talk. I want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world. I'll go around it. And then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York. So why? What are the implications. Why are we here? Well, we're here because the United States, we spent two trillion dollars on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were failed. We don't want to do that anymore. We have large numbers of middle and working classes that feel like they've not benefited from promises of globalization, so they don't want to see it particularly. And we have an energy revolution where we don't need OPEC or the Middle East the way we used to. We produce all that right here in the United States. So the Americans don't want to be the global sheriff for security or the architect of global trade. The Americans don't want to even be the cheerleader of global values. Well, then you look to Europe, and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship. But it is now weaker than it has been at any point since World War II, all of the crises, the Brexit conversations, the hedging going on between the French and the Russians, or the Germans and the Turks, or the Brits and the Chinese. China does want to do more leadership. They do, but only in the economic sphere, and they want their own values, standards, currency, in competition with that of the US. The Russians want to do more leadership. You see that in Ukraine, in the Baltic states, in the Middle East, but not with the Americans. They want their own preferences and order. That's why we are where we are. So what happens going forward? Let's start easy, with the Middle East. (Laughter) You know, I left a little out, but you get the general idea. Look, there are three reasons why the Middle East has had stability such as it is. Right? One is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the US and allies. Number two, it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive. And number three was no matter how bad the leaders were, the populations were relatively quiescent. They didn't have the ability, and many didn't have the will to really rise up against. Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world, all three of those things are increasingly not true, and so failed states, terrorism, refugees and the rest. Does the entire Middle East fall apart? No, the Kurds will do better, and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time. But generally speaking, it's not a good look. OK, how about this guy? He's playing a poor hand very well. There's no question he's hitting above his weight. But long term -- I didn't mean that. But long term, long term, if you think that the Russians were antagonized by the US and Europe expanding NATO right up to their borders when we said they weren't going to, and the EU encroaching them, just wait until the Chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars in every country around Russia they thought they had influence in. The Chinese are going to dominate it. The Russians are picking up the crumbs. In a G-Zero world, this is going to be a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin. It's not all bad. Right? Asia actually looks a lot better. There are real leaders across Asia, they have a lot of political stability. They're there for a while. Mr. Modi in India, Mr. Abe, who is probably about to get a third term written in in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, of course Xi Jinping who is consolidating enormous power, the most powerful leader in China since Mao. Those are the three most important economies in Asia. Now look, there are problems in Asia. We see the sparring over the South China Sea. We see that Kim Jong Un, just in the last couple of days, tested yet another nuclear weapon. But the leaders in Asia do not feel the need to wave the flag, to go xenophobic, to actually allow escalation of the geopolitical and cross-border tensions. They want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth. And that's what they're actually doing. Let's turn to Europe. Europe does look a little scared in this environment. So much of what is happening in the Middle East is washing up quite literally onto European shores. You see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism across all of the European states. Let me tell you that over the long term, in a G-Zero world, European expansion will be seen to have gone too far. Europe went right up to Russia, went right down to the Middle East, and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more Americanized, that would be less of a problem, but in a G-Zero world, those countries nearest Russia and nearest the Middle East actually have different economic capabilities, different social stability and different political preferences and systems than core Europe. So Europe was able to truly expand under the G7, but under the G-Zero, Europe will get smaller. Core Europe around Germany and France and others will still work, be functional, stable, wealthy, integrated. But the periphery, countries like Greece and Turkey and others, will not look that good at all. Latin America, a lot of populism, made the economies not go so well. They had been more opposed to the United States for decades. Increasingly, they're coming back. We see that in Argentina. We see it with the openness in Cuba. We will see it in Venezuela when Maduro falls. We will see it in Brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there. The only place you see that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of Mexican president Peña Nieto. There you could actually see a slip away from the United States over the coming years. The US election matters a lot on that one, too. (Laughter) Africa, right? A lot of people have said it's going to be Africa's decade, finally. In a G-Zero world, it is absolutely an amazing time for a few African countries, those governed well with a lot of urbanization, a lot of smart people, women really getting into the workforce, entrepreneurship taking off. But for most of the countries in Africa, it's going to be a lot more dicey: extreme climate conditions, radicalism both from Islam and also Christianity, very poor governance, borders you can't defend, lots of forced migration. Those countries can fall off the map. So you're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across Africa. Finally, back to the United States. What do I think about us? Because there are a lot of upset people, not here at TEDx, I know, but in the United States, my God, after 15 months of campaigning, we should be upset. I understand that. But a lot of people are upset because they say, ""Washington's broken, we don't trust the establishment, we hate the media."" Heck, even globalists like me are taking it on the chin. Look, I do think we have to recognize, my fellow campers, that when you are being chased by the bear, in the global context, you need not outrun the bear, you need to only outrun your fellow campers. (Laughter) Now, I just told you about our fellow campers. Right? And from that perspective, we look OK. A lot of people in that context say, ""Let's go dollar. Let's go New York real estate. Let's send our kids to American universities."" You know, our neighbors are awesome: Canada, Mexico and two big bodies of water. You know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that? Those are awesome neighbors. Terrorism is a problem in the United States. God knows we know it here in New York. But it's a much bigger problem in Europe than the US. It's a much bigger problem in the Middle East than it is in Europe. These are factors of large magnitude. We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees, and we're complaining bitterly about it. You know why? Because they can't swim here. Right? I mean, the Turks would love to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees. The Jordanians, the Germans, the Brits. Right? That's not the situation. That's the reality of the United States. Now, that sounds pretty good. Here's the challenge. In a G-Zero world, the way you lead is by example. If we know we don't want to be the global cop anymore, if we know we're not going to be the architect of global trade, we're not going to be the cheerleader of global values, we're not going to do it the way we used to, the 21st century is changing, we need to lead by example -- be so compelling that all these other people are going to still say, it's not just they're faster campers. Even when the bear is not chasing us, this is a good place to be. We want to emulate them. The election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example. Hillary Clinton says it's going to be like the '90s. We can still be that cheerleader on values. We can still be the architect of global trade. We can still be the global sheriff. And Donald Trump wants to bring us back to the '30s. He's saying, ""Our way or the highway. You don't like it, lump it."" Right? Neither are recognizing a fundamental truth of the G-Zero, which is that even though the US is not in decline, it is getting objectively harder for the Americans to impose their will, even have great influence, on the global order. Are we prepared to truly lead by example? What would we have to do to fix this after November, after the next president comes in? Well, either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond. A depression would do that. Another global financial crisis could do this. God forbid, another 9/11 could do that. Or, absent crisis, we need to see that the hollowing out, the inequality, the challenges that are growing and growing in the United States, are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change, and that we have those voices. Through our cell phones, individually, we have those voices to compel them to change. There is, of course, a third choice, perhaps the most likely one, which is that we do neither of those things, and in four years time you invite me back, and I will give this speech yet again. Thank you very, very much. (Applause)"
12:42,Sayu Bhojwani,Immigrant voices make democracy stronger,Oct 2016,"Good evening. My journey to this stage began when I came to America at the age of 17. You see, I'm one of the 84 million Americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants. Each of us has a dream when we come here, a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed. I was one of the lucky ones. My revised dream led me to the work I do today: training immigrants to run for public office and leading a movement for inclusive democracy. But I don't want you to think it was a cakewalk, that America opened its arms wide and welcomed me. It's still not doing that. And I've learned a few lessons along the way that I wanted to share with you, because I think that together we can make American democracy better and stronger. I was born in India, the world's largest democracy, and when I was four, my family moved to Belize, the world's smallest democracy perhaps. And at the age of 17, I moved to the United States, the world's greatest democracy. I came because I wanted to study English literature. You see, as a child, I buried my nose in books, and I thought, why not make a living doing that as an adult? But after I graduated from college and got a graduate degree, I found myself moving from one less ideal job to another. Maybe it was the optimism that I had about America that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change. The door that I thought was open was actually just slightly ajar -- this door of America that would open wide if you had the right name, the right skin color, the right networks, but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion, the wrong immigration status, the wrong skin color. And I just couldn't accept that. So I started a career as a social entrepreneur, starting an organization for young people like myself -- I was young at the time that I started it -- who traced their heritage to the Indian subcontinent. In that work, I became and advocate for South Asians and other immigrants. I lobbied members of Congress on policy issues. I volunteered on election day to do exit polling. But I couldn't vote, and I couldn't run for office. So in 2000, when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from 95 dollars to 225 dollars, I decided it was time to apply before I could no longer afford it. I filled out a long application, answering questions about my current and my past affiliations. And once the application was submitted, there were fingerprints to be taken, a test to study for, endless hours of waiting in line. You might call it extreme vetting. And then in December of 2000, I joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in Brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long considered home. My journey from international student to American citizen took 16 years, a short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories. And soon after I had taken that formal step to becoming an American, the attacks of September 11, 2001, changed the immigration landscape for decades to come. My city, New York City, was reeling and healing, and in the midst of it, we were in an election cycle. Two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in New York City. Voters elected Michael Bloomberg mayor of New York City. We also adopted by ballot referendum the Office of Immigrant Affairs for the City of New York. Five months after that election, the newly elected mayor appointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for this newly established office. I want you to come back to that time. I was a young immigrant woman from Belize. I had basically floundered in various jobs in America before I started a community-based organization in a church basement in Queens. The attacks of September 11 sent shock waves through my community. People who were members of my family, young people I had worked with, were experiencing harassment at schools, at workplaces and in airports. And now I was going to represent their concerns in government. No job felt more perfect for me. And here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner. First, well-meaning New Yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of law enforcement. Most of us don't really know the difference, do we, between a sheriff and local police and the FBI. And most of us, when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity, if not concern. So if you're an undocumented parent, every day when you say goodbye to your child, send them off to school and go to work, you don't know what the chances are that you're going to see them at the end of the day. Because a raid at your workplace, a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever. The second thing I learned is that when people like me, who understood that fear, who had learned a new language, who had navigated new systems, when people like us were sitting at the table, we advocated for our communities' needs in a way that no one else could or would. I understood what that feeling of fear was like. People in my family were experiencing it. Young people I had worked with were being harassed, not just by classmates, but also by their teachers. My husband, then boyfriend, thought twice before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much. What I learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered. And it's these three things -- immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points -- that I think can help make our democracy stronger. We actually have the power to change the outcome of elections, to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face of the pale, male, stale leadership that we have in our country today. So how do we do that? Well, let's talk first about votes. It will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in America are white. But it might surprise you to know that one in three voters are black, Latino or Asian. But here's the thing: it doesn't just matter who can vote, it matters who does vote. So in 2012, half of the Latino and Asian-American voters did not vote. And these votes matter not just in presidential elections. They matter in local and state elections. In 2015, Lan Diep, the eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam, ran for a seat in the San Jose City Council. He lost that election by 13 votes. This year, he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat, and this time he won, by 12 votes. Every one of our votes matters. And when people like Lan are sitting at the policy table, they can make a difference. We need those voices. We need those voices in part because American leadership does not look like America's residents. There are over 500,000 local and state offices in America. Fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos, the two largest immigrant groups in our country. In the city of Yakima, Washington, where 49 percent of the population is Latino, there has never been a Latino on the city council until this year. Three newly elected Latinas joined the Yakima City Council in 2016. One of them is Carmen Méndez. She is a first-generation college student. She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico, and partly in Yakima, Washington. She's a single mother, a community advocate. Her voice on the Yakima City Council is advocating on behalf of the Latino community and of all Yakima residents. And she's a role model for her daughter and other Latinas. But the third most untapped resource in American democracy is the vantage point that immigrants bring. We have fought to be here. We have come for economic and educational opportunity. We have come for political and religious freedom. We have come in the pursuit of love. That dedication, that commitment to America we also bring to public service. People like Athena Salman, who just last week won the primary for a seat in the Arizona State House. Athena's father grew up in the West Bank and moved to Chicago, where he met her mother. Her mother is part Italian, part Mexican and part German. Together they moved to Arizona and built a life. Athena, when she gets to the statehouse, is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up so they can achieve the financial stability that we all are looking for. Immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points are what we all need to work to include in American democracy. It's not just my work. It's also yours. And it's not going to be easy. We never know what putting a new factor into an equation will do. And it's a little scary. You're scared that I'm going to take away your place at the table, and I'm scared that I'm never going to get a place at the table. And we're all scared that we're going to lose this country that we know and love. I'm scared you're going to take it away from me, and you're scared I'm going to take it away from you. Look, it's been a rough election year, a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader. But I have fought to be in this country and I continue to do so every day. So my optimism never wavers, because I know that there are millions of immigrants just like me, in front of me, behind me and all around me. It's our country, too. Thank you. (Applause)"
14:42,J.D. Vance,America's forgotten working class,Sep 2016,"I remember the very first time I went to a nice restaurant, a really nice restaurant. It was for a law firm recruitment dinner, and I remember beforehand the waitress walked around and asked whether we wanted some wine, so I said, ""Sure, I'll take some white wine."" And she immediately said, ""Would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?"" And I remember thinking, ""Come on, lady, stop with the fancy French words and just give me some white wine."" But I used my powers of deduction and recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc were two separate types of white wine, and so I told her that I would take the chardonnay, because frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce for me. So I had a lot of experiences like that during my first couple of years as a law student at Yale, because, despite all outward appearances, I'm a cultural outsider. I didn't come from the elites. I didn't come from the Northeast or from San Francisco. I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's really struggling in a lot of ways, ways that are indicative of the broader struggles of America's working class. Heroin has moved in, killing a lot of people, people I know. Family violence, domestic violence, and divorce have torn apart families. And there's a very unique sense of pessimism that's moved in. Think about rising mortality rates in these communities and recognize that for a lot of these folks, the problems that they're seeing are actually causing rising death rates in their own communities, so there's a very real sense of struggle. I had a very front-row seat to that struggle. My family has been part of that struggle for a very long time. I come from a family that doesn't have a whole lot of money. The addiction that plagued my community also plagued my family, and even, sadly, my own mom. There were a lot of problems that I saw in my own family, problems caused sometimes by a lack of money, problems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital that really affected my life. If you had looked at my life when I was 14 years old and said, ""Well, what's going to happen to this kid?"" you would have concluded that I would have struggled with what academics call upward mobility. So upward mobility is an abstract term, but it strikes at something that's very core at the heart of the American Dream. It's the sense, and it measures whether kids like me who grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life, whether they're going to have a chance to live a materially better existence, or whether they're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from. And one of the things we've learned, unfortunately, is that upward mobility isn't as high as we'd like it to be in this country, and interestingly, it's very geographically distributed. So take Utah, for instance. In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK, very likely to live their share and their part in the American Dream. But if you think of where I'm from, in the South, in Appalachia, in southern Ohio, it's very unlikely that kids like that will rise. The American Dream in those parts of the country is in a very real sense just a dream. So why is that happening? So one reason is obviously economic or structural. So you think of these areas. They're beset by these terrible economic trends, built around industries like coal and steel that make it harder for folks to get ahead. That's certainly one problem. There's also the problem of brain drain, where the really talented people, because they can't find high-skilled work at home, end up moving elsewhere, so they don't build a business or non-profit where they're from, they end up going elsewhere and taking their talents with them. There are failing schools in a lot of these communities, failing to give kids the educational leg up that really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life. These things are all important. I don't mean to discount these structural barriers. But when I look back at my life and my community, something else was going on, something else mattered. It's difficult to quantify, but it was no less real. So for starters, there was a very real sense of hopelessness in the community that I grew up in. There was a sense that kids had that their choices didn't matter. No matter what happened, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how hard they tried to get ahead, nothing good would happen. So that's a tough feeling to grow up around. That's a tough mindset to penetrate, and it leads sometimes to very conspiratorial places. So let's just take one political issue that's pretty hot, affirmative action. So depending on your politics, you might think that affirmative action is either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace or the classroom. But if you grow up in an area like this, you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back. That's especially true if you're a member of the white working class. You see it as something that isn't just about good or bad policy. You see it as something that's actively conspiring, where people with political and financial power are working against you. And there are a lot of ways that you see that conspiracy against you -- perceived, real, but it's there, and it warps expectations. So if you think about what do you do when you grow up in that world, you can respond in a couple of ways. One, you can say, ""I'm not going to work hard, because no matter how hard I work, it's not going to matter."" Another thing you might do is say, ""Well, I'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success, like a university education or a prestigious job, because the people who care about those things are unlike me. They're never going to let me in."" When I got admitted to Yale, a family member asked me if I had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee. Seriously. And it's obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check on the application, but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places that you have to pretend to be somebody you're not to get past these various social barriers. It's a very significant problem. Even if you don't give in to that hopelessness, even if you think, let's say, that your choices matter and you want to make the good choices, you want to do better for yourself and for your family, it's sometimes hard to even know what those choices are when you grow up in a community like I did. I didn't know, for example, that you had to go to law school to be a lawyer. I didn't know that elite universities, as research consistently tells us, are cheaper for low-income kids because these universities have bigger endowments, can offer more generous financial aid. I remember I learned this when I got the financial aid letter from Yale for myself, tens of thousands of dollars in need-based aid, which is a term I had never heard before. But I turned to my aunt when I got that letter and said, ""You know, I think this just means that for the first time in my life, being poor has paid really well."" So I didn't have access to that information because the social networks around me didn't have access to that information. I learned from my community how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well. I learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe. The trick, by the way, is frozen butter, not warm butter. But I didn't learn how to get ahead. I didn't learn how to make the good decisions about education and opportunity that you need to make to actually have a chance in this 21st century knowledge economy. Economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks, from our friends and colleagues and family ""social capital."" The social capital that I had wasn't built for 21st century America, and it showed. There's something else that's really important that's going on that our community doesn't like to talk about, but it's very real. Working-class kids are much more likely to face what's called adverse childhood experiences, which is just a fancy word for childhood trauma: getting hit or yelled at, put down by a parent repeatedly, watching someone hit or beat your parent, watching someone do drugs or abuse alcohol. These are all instances of childhood trauma, and they're pretty commonplace in my family. Importantly, they're not just commonplace in my family right now. They're also multigenerational. So my grandparents, the very first time that they had kids, they expected that they were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good. They were middle class, they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill. But what ended up happening is that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma that had gone back many generations. My mom was 12 when she saw my grandma set my grandfather on fire. His crime was that he came home drunk after she told him, ""If you come home drunk, I'm gonna kill you."" And she tried to do it. Think about the way that that affects a child's mind. And we think of these things as especially rare, but a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund found that 40 percent of low-income kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma, compared to only 29 percent for upper-income kids. And think about what that really means. If you're a low-income kid, almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma. This is not an isolated problem. This is a very significant issue. We know what happens to the kids who experience that life. They're more likely to do drugs, more likely to go to jail, more likely to drop out of high school, and most importantly, they're more likely to do to their children what their parents did to them. This trauma, this chaos in the home, is our culture's very worst gift to our children, and it's a gift that keeps on giving. So you combine all that, the hopelessness, the despair, the cynicism about the future, the childhood trauma, the low social capital, and you begin to understand why me, at the age of 14, was ready to become just another statistic, another kid who failed to beat the odds. But something unexpected happened. I did beat the odds. Things turned up for me. I graduated from high school, from college, I went to law school, and I have a pretty good job now. So what happened? Well, one thing that happened is that my grandparents, the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame, they really shaped up by the time I came around. They provided me a stable home, a stable family. They made sure that when my parents weren't able to do the things that kids need, they stepped in and filled that role. My grandma especially did two things that really matter. One, she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework and the things that kids should be focused on. But she was also this incredibly perceptive woman, despite not even having a middle school education. She recognized the message that my community had for me, that my choices didn't matter, that the deck was stacked against me. She once told me, ""JD, never be like those losers who think the deck is stacked against them. You can do anything you want to."" And yet she recognized that life wasn't fair. It's hard to strike that balance, to tell a kid that life isn't fair, but also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter. But mamaw was able to strike that balance. The other thing that really helped was the United States Marine Corps. So we think of the Marine Corps as a military outfit, and of course it is, but for me, the US Marine Corps was a four-year crash course in character education. It taught me how to make a bed, how to do laundry, how to wake up early, how to manage my finances. These are things my community didn't teach me. I remember when I went to go buy a car for the very first time, I was offered a dealer's low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent, and I was ready to sign on the dotted line. But I didn't take that deal, because I went and took it to my officer who told me, ""Stop being an idiot, go to the local credit union, and get a better deal."" And so that's what I did. But without the Marine Corps, I would have never had access to that knowledge. I would have had a financial calamity, frankly. The last thing I want to say is that I had a lot of good fortune in the mentors and people who have played an important role in my life. From the Marines, from Ohio State, from Yale, from other places, people have really stepped in and ensured that they filled that social capital gap that it was pretty obvious, apparently, that I had. That comes from good fortune, but a lot of children aren't going to have that good fortune, and I think that raises really important questions for all of us about how we're going to change that. We need to ask questions about how we're going to give low-income kids who come from a broken home access to a loving home. We need to ask questions about how we're going to teach low-income parents how to better interact with their children, with their partners. We need to ask questions about how we give social capital, mentorship to low-income kids who don't have it. We need to think about how we teach working class children about not just hard skills, like reading, mathematics, but also soft skills, like conflict resolution and financial management. Now, I don't have all of the answers. I don't know all of the solutions to this problem, but I do know this: in southern Ohio right now, there's a kid who is anxiously awaiting their dad, wondering whether, when he comes through the door, he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly. There's a kid whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out, and he doesn't know why she doesn't cook him dinner, and he goes to bed hungry that night. There's a kid who has no hope for the future but desperately wants to live a better life. They just want somebody to show it to them. I don't have all the answers, but I know that unless our society starts asking better questions about why I was so lucky and about how to get that luck to more of our communities and our country's children, we're going to continue to have a very significant problem. Thank you. (Applause)"
7:10,Nadia Lopez,Why open a school? To close a prison,Sep 2016,"When I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010, my goal was simple: open a school to close a prison. Now to some, this was an audacious goal, because our school is located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn -- one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of New York City. Like many urban schools with high poverty rates, we face numerous challenges, like finding teachers who can empathize with the complexities of a disadvantaged community, lack of funding for technology, low parental involvement and neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade. So here I was, the founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school, and I only had 45 kids to start. Thirty percent of them had special needs. Eighty-six percent of them were below grade level in English and in math. And 100 percent were living below the poverty level. If our children are not in our classrooms, how will they learn? And if they're not learning, where would they end up? It was evident when I would ask my 13-year-old, ""Young man, where do you see yourself in five years?"" And his response: ""I don't know if I'm gonna live that long."" Or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant. To me, this was unacceptable. It was also evident that they had no idea that there was a landscape of opportunity that existed beyond their neighborhood. We call our students ""scholars,"" because they're lifelong learners. And the skills that they learn today will prepare them for college and career readiness. I chose the royal colors of purple and black, because I want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness, and that through education, they are future engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs and even leaders who can and will take over this world. To date, we have had three graduating classes, at a 98 -- (Applause) At a 98-percent graduation rate. This is nearly 200 children, who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools in New York City. (Applause) It was a cold day in January when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet, met Brandon Stanton, the founder of the popular blog ""Humans of New York."" Brandon shared the story of a young man from Brownsville who had witnessed violence firsthand, by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof. Yet he can still be influenced by a principal who had opened up a school that believes in all children. Vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children who are struggling to survive, which is why we must make education a priority. Brandon's post created a global sensation that touched the lives of millions. This resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised for our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities, Summer STEAM programs, as well as college scholarships. You need to understand that when 200 young people from Brownsville visited Harvard, they now understood that a college of their choice was a real possibility. And the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose. The revolution in education is happening in our schools, with adults who provide love, structure, support and knowledge. These are the things that inspire children. But it is not an easy task. And there are high demands within an education system that is not perfect. But I have a dynamic group of educators who collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum. They take time beyond their school day, and come in on weekends and even use their own money to often provide resources when we do not have it. And as the principal, I have to inspect what I expect. So I show up in classes and I conduct observations to give feedback, because I want my teachers to be just as successful as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy. And I give them access to me every single day, which is why they all have my personal cell number, including my scholars and those who graduated -- which is probably why I get phone calls and text messages at three o'clock in the morning. (Laughter) But we are all connected to succeed, and good leaders do this. Tomorrow's future is sitting in our classrooms. And they are our responsibility. That means everyone in here, and those who are watching the screen. We must believe in their brilliance, and remind them by teaching them that there indeed is power in education. Thank you. (Applause)"
15:38,Michael Murphy,Architecture that's built to heal,Sep 2016,"Every weekend for as long as I can remember, my father would get up on a Saturday, put on a worn sweatshirt and he'd scrape away at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in. I wouldn't even call it restoration; it was a ritual, catharsis. He would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun and a spackle knife, and then he would repaint where he scraped, only to begin again the following year. Scraping and re-scraping, painting and repainting: the work of an old house is never meant to be done. The day my father turned 52, I got a phone call. My mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach -- terminal cancer, she told me, and he had been given only three weeks to live. I immediately moved home to Poughkeepsie, New York, to sit with my father on death watch, not knowing what the next days would bring us. To keep myself distracted, I rolled up my sleeves, and I went about finishing what he could now no longer complete -- the restoration of our old home. When that looming three-week deadline came and then went, he was still alive. And at three months, he joined me. We gutted and repainted the interior. At six months, the old windows were refinished, and at 18 months, the rotted porch was finally replaced. And there was my father, standing with me outside, admiring a day's work, hair on his head, fully in remission, when he turned to me and he said, ""You know, Michael, this house saved my life."" So the following year, I decided to go to architecture school. (Laughter) But there, I learned something different about buildings. Recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms, like ribbons, or ... pickles? (Laughter) And I think this is supposed to be a snail. Something about this bothered me. Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture -- all beautiful and visionary and innovative -- is also so rare, and seems to serve so very few? And more to the point: With all of this creative talent, what more could we do? Just as I was about to start my final exams, I decided to take a break from an all-nighter and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer, a leading health activist for the global poor. I was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture. Buildings are making people sicker, he said, and for the poorest in the world, this is causing epidemic-level problems. In this hospital in South Africa, patients that came in with, say, a broken leg, to wait in this unventilated hallway, walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis. Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about, and people had died because of it. ""Where are the architects?"" Paul said. If hospitals are making people sicker, where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal? That following summer, I was in the back of a Land Rover with a few classmates, bumping over the mountainous hillside of Rwanda. For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro in this old guesthouse, which was a jail after the genocide. I was there to design and build a new type of hospital with Dr. Farmer and his team. If hallways are making patients sicker, what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside, and makes people walk in the exterior? If mechanical systems rarely work, what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation, and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint? And what about the patients' experience? Evidence shows that a simple view of nature can radically improve health outcomes, So why couldn't we design a hospital where every patient had a window with a view? Simple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals. Designing it is one thing; getting it built, we learned, is quite another. We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called ""Ubudehe,"" which means ""community works for the community."" Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. Bruce was using the process of building to heal, not just for those who were sick, but for the entire community as a whole. We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or ""lo-fab,"" and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve. Think of it like the local food movement, but for architecture. And we're convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world, and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture. Using the lo-fab way of building, even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people's lives. In Butaro, we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area, but often considered a nuisance by farmers, and piled on the side of the road. We worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them into the walls of the hospital. And when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital, they were so good at putting these stones together, they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it. And you see what is possible. It's beautiful. And the beauty, to me, comes from the fact that I know that hands cut these stones, and they formed them into this thick wall, made only in this place with rocks from this soil. When you go outside today and you look at your built world, ask not only: ""What is the environmental footprint?"" -- an important question -- but what if we also asked, ""What is the human handprint of those who made it?"" We started a new practice based around these questions, and we tested it around the world. Like in Haiti, where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera. In this 100-bed hospital, we designed a simple strategy to clean contaminated medical waste before it enters the water table, and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO are already saving lives because of it. Or Malawi: we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce maternal and infant mortality. Malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death in the world. Using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally, we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants to come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births. Or in the Congo, where we asked if an educational center could also be used to protect endangered wildlife. Poaching for ivory and bushmeat is leading to global epidemic, disease transfer and war. In one of the hardest-to-reach places in the world, we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us to construct a center that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity. Even here in the US, we were asked to rethink the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world. The deaf community, through sign language, shows us the power of visual communication. We designed a campus that would awaken the ways in which we as humans all communicate, both verbally and nonverbally. And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown, we thought about old industrial infrastructure. We wondered: Could we use arts and culture and design to revitalize this city and other Rust Belt cities across our nation, and turn them into centers for innovation and growth? In each of these projects, we asked a simple question: What more can architecture do? And by asking that question, we were forced to consider how we could create jobs, how we could source regionally and how we could invest in the dignity of the communities in which we serve. I have learned that architecture can be a transformative engine for change. About a year ago, I read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader named Bryan Stevenson. (Applause) And Bryan had a bold architectural vision. He and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of African-Americans that have happened in the American South. And they had a plan to mark every county where these lynchings occurred, and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in Montgomery, Alabama. Countries like Germany and South Africa and, of course, Rwanda, have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past, in order to heal their national psyche. We have yet to do this in the United States. So I sent a cold email to info@equaljusticeintiative.org: ""Dear Bryan,"" it said, ""I think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in America and could change the way we think about racial injustice. By any chance, do you know who will design it?"" (Laughter) Surprisingly, shockingly, Bryan got right back to me, and invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them. Needless to say, I canceled all my meetings and I jumped on a plane to Montgomery, Alabama. When I got there, Bryan and his team picked me up, and we walked around the city. And they took the time to point out the many markers that have been placed all over the city to the history of the Confederacy, and the very few that mark the history of slavery. And then he walked me to a hill. It overlooked the whole city. He pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic slave-trading port in America had once prospered. And then to the Capitol rotunda, where George Wallace had stood on its steps and proclaimed, ""Segregation forever."" And then to the very hill below us. He said, ""Here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity of this city and of this nation."" Our two teams have worked together over the last year to design this memorial. The memorial will take us on a journey through a classical, almost familiar building type, like the Parthenon or the colonnade at the Vatican. But as we enter, the ground drops below us and our perception shifts, where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings, which happened in the public square. And as we continue, we begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest. Their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us. And just outside will be a field of identical columns. But these are temporary columns, waiting in purgatory, to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred. Over the next few years, this site will bear witness, as each of these markers is claimed and visibly placed in those counties. Our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence. When we think about how it should be built, we were reminded of Ubudehe, the building process we learned about in Rwanda. We wondered if we could fill those very columns with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred. Brian and his team have begun collecting that soil and preserving it in individual jars with family members, community leaders and descendants. The act of collecting soil itself has lead to a type of spiritual healing. It's an act of restorative justice. As one EJI team member noted in the collection of the soil from where Will McBride was lynched, ""If Will McBride left one drop of sweat, one drop of blood, one hair follicle -- I pray that I dug it up, and that his whole body would be at peace."" We plan to break ground on this memorial later this year, and it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation. (Applause) When my father told me that day that this house -- our house -- had saved his life, what I didn't know was that he was referring to a much deeper relationship between architecture and ourselves. Buildings are not simply expressive sculptures. They make visible our personal and our collective aspirations as a society. Great architecture can give us hope. Great architecture can heal. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
15:32,Courtney E. Martin,The new American Dream,Sep 2016,"I'm a journalist, so I like to look for the untold stories, the lives that quietly play out under the scream of headlines. I've also been going about the business of putting down roots, choosing a partner, making babies. So for the last few years, I've been trying to understand what constitutes the 21st-century good life, both because I'm fascinated by the moral and philosophical implications, but also because I'm in desperate need of answers myself. We live in tenuous times. In fact, for the first time in American history, the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were. This is true of rich and poor, men and women. Now, some of you might hear this and feel sad. After all, America is deeply invested in this idea of economic transcendence, that every generation kind of leapfrogs the one before it, earning more, buying more, being more. We've exported this dream all over the world, so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya inherit our insatiable expectation for more. But when I read this historic poll for the first time, it didn't actually make me feel sad. It felt like a provocation. ""Better off"" -- based on whose standards? Is ""better off"" finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life? Those are nearly extinct. People move jobs, on average, every 4.7 years, and it's estimated that by 2020, nearly half of Americans will be freelancers. OK, so is better off just a number? Is it about earning as much as you possibly can? By that singular measurement, we are failing. Median per capita income has been flat since about 2000, adjusted for inflation. All right, so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence? Less of us are doing that. Nearly five million people lost their homes in the Great Recession, and even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go -- or be tricked into going, in many predatory cases -- to hold that deed. Home-ownership rates are at their lowest since 1995. All right, so we're not finding steady employment, we're not earning as much money, and we're not living in big fancy houses. Toll the funeral bells for everything that made America great. But, are those the best measurements of a country's greatness, of a life well lived? What I think makes America great is its spirit of reinvention. In the wake of the Great Recession, more and more Americans are redefining what ""better off"" really means. Turns out, it has more to do with community and creativity than dollars and cents. Now, let me be very clear: the 14.8 percent of Americans living in poverty need money, plain and simple. And all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation by employers and financial institutions. Nothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor is anything but profoundly immoral. But, too often we let the conversation stop there. We talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience; about the poor as if they were solely victims. Part of what I've learned in my research and reporting is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable. Now, if necessity is the mother of invention, I've come to believe that recession can be the father of consciousness. It confronts us with profound questions, questions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask in times of relative comfort. How should we work? How should we live? All of us, whether we realize it or not, seek answers to these questions, with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears. My great-grandfather was a drunk in Detroit, who sometimes managed to hold down a factory job. He had, as unbelievable as it might sound, 21 children, with one woman, my great-grandmother, who died at 47 years old of ovarian cancer. Now, I'm pregnant with my second child, and I cannot even fathom what she must have gone through. And if you're trying to do the math -- there were six sets of twins. So my grandfather, their son, became a traveling salesman, and he lived boom and bust. So my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors and pretending his parents weren't home. He actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage, when his father admitted he didn't have money to go back to the orthodontist. So my dad, unsurprisingly, became a bankruptcy lawyer. Couldn't write this in a novel, right? He was obsessed with providing a secure foundation for my brother and I. So I ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle. My parents made sure that I grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap. And ironically, and probably sometimes to their frustration, it is their steadfast commitment to security that allows me to question its value, or at least its value as we've historically defined it in the 21st century. So let's dig into this first question: How should we work? We should work like our mothers. That's right -- we've spent decades trying to fit women into a work world built for company men. And many have done backbends to fit in, but others have carved a more unconventional path, creating a patchwork of meaning and money with enough flexibility to do what they need to do for those that they love. My mom called it ""just making it work."" Today I hear life coaches call it ""a portfolio career."" Whatever you call it, more and more men are craving these whole, if not harried, lives. They're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons. Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said, ""Labor is a way of knowing."" Labor is a way of knowing. In other words, what we work on is what we understand about the world. If this is true, and I think it is, then women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones and the sick ones and the aging ones, have disproportionately benefited from the most profound kind of knowing there is: knowing the human condition. By prioritizing care, men are, in a sense, staking their claim to the full range of human existence. Now, this means the nine-to-five no longer works for anyone. Punch clocks are becoming obsolete, as are career ladders. Whole industries are being born and dying every day. It's all nonlinear from here. So we need to stop asking kids, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" and start asking them, ""How do you want to be when you grow up?"" Their work will constantly change. The common denominator is them. So the more they understand their gifts and create crews of ideal collaborators, the better off they will be. The challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net to fit this increasingly fragmented economy. We need portable health benefits. We need policies that reflect that everyone deserves to be vulnerable or care for vulnerable others, without becoming destitute. We need to seriously consider a universal basic income. We need to reinvent labor organizing. The promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit our 21st century values, not some archaic idea about bringing home the bacon, is long overdue -- just ask your mother. Now, how about the second question: How should we live? We should live like our immigrant ancestors. When they came to America, they often shared apartments, survival tactics, child care -- always knew how to fill one more belly, no matter how small the food available. But they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream, the white picket fence. And even today, we see a white picket fence and we think success, self-possession. But when you strip away the sentimentality, what it really does is divides us. Many Americans are rejecting the white picket fence and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it, and reclaiming village life, reclaiming interdependence instead. Fifty million of us, for example, live in intergenerational households. This number exploded with the Great Recession, but it turns out people actually like living this way. Two-thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof say it's improved their relationships. Some people are choosing to share homes not with family, but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community. CoAbode, an online platform for single moms looking to share homes with other single moms, has 50,000 users. And people over 65 are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements. They understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity. Which is true of all of us when you think about it, young and old alike. For too long, we've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle. But all the research proves otherwise. It shows that the healthiest, happiest and even safest -- in terms of both climate change disaster, in terms of crime, all of that -- are Americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors. Now, I've experienced this firsthand. For the last few years, I've been living in a cohousing community. It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees, this prolific blackberry bush that snakes around a community garden, all smack-dab, by the way, in the middle of urban Oakland. The nine units are all built to be different, different sizes, different shapes, but they're meant to be as green as possible. So big, shiny black solar cells on our roof mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds more than five bucks in a month. The 25 of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions and professions, and we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have. But additionally, we share an industrial-sized kitchen and eating area, where we have common meals twice a week. Now, people, when I tell them I live like this, often have one of two extreme reactions. Either they say, ""Why doesn't everyone live like this?"" Or they say, ""That sounds totally horrifying. I would never want to do that."" So let me reassure you: there is a sacred respect for privacy among us, but also a commitment to what we call ""radical hospitality"" -- not the kind advertised by the Four Seasons, but the kind that says that every single person is worthy of kindness, full stop, end of sentence. The biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this? You share all the domestic labor -- the repairing, the cooking, the weeding -- but you also share the emotional labor. Rather than depending only on the idealized family unit to get all of your emotional needs met, you have two dozen other people that you can go to to talk about a hard day at work or troubleshoot how to handle an abusive teacher. Teenagers in our community will often go to an adult that is not their parent to ask for advice. It's what bell hooks called ""revolutionary parenting,"" this humble acknowledgment that kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults to emulate and count on. Turns out, adults are healthier, too. It's a lot of pressure, trying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence. The ""new better off,"" as I've come to call it, is less about investing in the perfect family and more about investing in the imperfect village, whether that's relatives living under one roof, a cohousing community like mine, or just a bunch of neighbors who pledge to really know and look out for one another. It's good common sense, right? And yet, money has often made us dumb about reaching out. The most reliable wealth is found in relationship. The new better off is not an individual prospect at all. In fact, if you're a failure or you think you're a failure, I've got some good news for you: you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored. Maybe you're a mediocre earner but a masterful father. Maybe you can't afford your dream home, but you throw legendary neighborhood parties. If you're a textbook success, the implications of what I'm saying could be more grim for you. You might be a failure by standards you hold dear but that the world doesn't reward. Only you can know. I know that I am not a tribute to my great-grandmother, who lived such a short and brutish life, if I earn enough money to afford every creature comfort. You can't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning. There is no home big enough to erase the pain that she must have endured. I am a tribute to her if I live a life as connected and courageous as possible. In the midst of such widespread uncertainty, we may, in fact, be insecure. But we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple. We can turn inward, lose faith in the power of institutions to change -- even lose faith in ourselves. Or we can turn outward, cultivate faith in our ability to reach out, to connect, to create. Turns out, the biggest danger is not failing to achieve the American Dream. The biggest danger is achieving a dream that you don't actually believe in. So don't do that. Do the harder, more interesting thing, which is to compose a life where what you do every single day, the people you give your best love and ingenuity and energy to, aligns as closely as possible with what you believe. That, not something as mundane as making money, is a tribute to your ancestors. That is the beautiful struggle. Thank you. (Applause)"
8:38,John Legend,"""Redemption Song""",Jul 2016,"At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour. We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons. We've gone to immigration detention centers. We've met a lot of people. And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time. Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline. What would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value -- with love and compassion as core values? We would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in. I want to introduce you to James Cavitt. James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months. Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done. He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet. He committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again. Now James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together. I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word. James Cavitt: Thanks, John. TED, welcome to San Quentin. The talent is abundant behind prison walls. Future software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists. This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time. This piece is entitled, ""Where I Live."" I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go. Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow. I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong. Imagine that. Better yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong. Maybe then we would all be singin' ""Redemption Song."" I live in a world that has been called ""hell on Earth"" by those trapped inside. But I've come to the stark realization that prison -- it really is what you make it. You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining. I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom. And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom. Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons. We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom! Don't you get it? We're all serving time; we're just in different places. As for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created. The key: forgiveness. Action's my witness. If we want freedom, then we gotta think different. Because freedom ... it isn't a place. It's a mind setting. Thank you. (Applause) (Piano) John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.

4:02,Peter Paccone,Why is the US Constitution so hard to amend?,May 2016,"When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution didn't just institute a government by the people. It provided a way for the people to alter the constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution so hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their  agreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive  a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds  of state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have its legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate  ratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today,  the American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments every couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand,  hasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any amendments managed to pass at all. The first ten,  known as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's  most well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from  the original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth  and Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments  has also become harder as the country has grown larger and more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign  congressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification in the 1790s. However, as more and more states joined the union, the number needed to reach  the three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many  suggested amendments, including outlawing  the burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support, their likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total population to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be to make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required for proposal and ratification. That, however, would require  its own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly come from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation of existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from  the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote  that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed since every political process  is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles  of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead."
13:49,Mary Bassett,Why your doctor should care about social justice,Feb 2016,"When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free. A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment. In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized. By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent. I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution. The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable. Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement. But there were daunting challenges. Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived. I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa. Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there. These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later. By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive. I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die. In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic. We did condom demonstrations. We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves. We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best. I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was. But I was not talking about structural change. Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department. At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, ""I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."" The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier. But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills. And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus. I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS. And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive. I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. Whites were largely unscathed. As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners. Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa. I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population. I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research. So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS. I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough. Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong. Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship. And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine. But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more. It was true of AIDS. It was true just recently of Ebola. Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent. We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices. Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together. So these days, I'm not staying quiet. I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable. And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health. But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short. That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner. In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones. A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman. And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby. New York City's not exceptional. These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States. A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country. They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death. There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter. But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely. As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word ""racism"" in our research and our work. You've probably felt something every time I've said it. Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality. And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health. As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child. Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change. Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that. I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity. I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality. It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality. We don't have to have all the answers to call for change. We just need courage. The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it. (Applause)"
16:16,Dalia Mogahed,What it's like to be Muslim in America,Feb 2016,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: ""Why are you oppressing yourself?"" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words ""Breaking News."" There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, ""... Muslim terrorist ...,"" ""... in the name of Islam ...,"" ""... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"" ""... jihad ...,"" ""... we should bomb Mecca."" Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school. And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world. And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, ""Be alert,"" ""Be aware,"" ""Stay in well-lit areas,"" ""Don't congregate."" I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship. And again the warnings were, ""Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target."" And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually saying things like, ""There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?"" So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques. They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is, are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque. Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen. We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school, talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, ""When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed. (Applause)"
14:04,Dambisa Moyo,Economic growth has stalled. Let's fix it,Feb 2016,"Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time. Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism. However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development. The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis? They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity. In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling. In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25? In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing. Economic growth matters. With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller. The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries. Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt. But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism. The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state. It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance. Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist. Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism. However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many. The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills. In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today? Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model. I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism. In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that. Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York. But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction. Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector. Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships. More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society. My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work. Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way? DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world. BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening? DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is. However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do. BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting? DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model. These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient. I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know. BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say? DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded. As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets. BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED. DM: Thank you very much. (Applause)"
19:51,Yanis Varoufakis,Capitalism will eat democracy — unless we speak up,Jan 2016,"Democracy. In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free. Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe. Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy. And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted. Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy. Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth. $3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices. So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks,  failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets. The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him. This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth. Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government. Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded. What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly. And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters. And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone. Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power. Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated. (Laughter) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate. Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve. Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations. So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth. Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants. Now, this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it? The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste. But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China. So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary. (Laughter) So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora. I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia? In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples. At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks. At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it ""the cosmos,"" in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce. This is not a new idea. It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere. The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian. But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy. Will such a world dawn? Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused. (Laughter) BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now. (Laughter) (Applause) YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK? BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV: That was Einstein, actually -- BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that? YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone. In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century. Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically. Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy. BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year. YV: I knew this was coming. BG: Yes. BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year? YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece, the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process. We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right. And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial. But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically. BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing? YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future. BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister? YV: Every day. BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back -- (Applause) No, but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes. The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one-third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, ""This was a colossal mistake."" BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European. YV: Absolutely. Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy. We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike. BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point. Yanis, thank you for coming to TED. YV: Thank you. (Applause)"
18:00,David Rothkopf,How fear drives American politics,Sep 2015,"What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging. I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety. I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey. (Laughter) I could worry before I could walk. (Laughter) Please, applaud that. (Applause) Thank you. But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear. We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war. Now even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work. But I also knew that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with. And yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years with the threat of such a war, the response of our government and of our society was to do wonderful things. We created the space program in response to that. We built our highway system in response to that. We created the Internet in response to that. So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response. But sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response. On September 11, 2001, 19 guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings. They exacted a horrible toll. It is not for us to minimize what that toll was. But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate -- disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged. We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States and of many governments to address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place, was quite limited. In fact, according to our intelligence services, on September 11, 2001, there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda. There were just a few thousand terrorists. They posed an existential threat to no one. But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War. We launched two wars. We spent trillions of dollars. We suspended our values. We violated international law. We embraced torture. We embraced the idea that if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it. And therefore, for the first time in history, we were seeing everybody as a threat. And what was the result of that? Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries -- hundreds of millions of people -- setting aside whether those countries were our allies, setting aside what our interests were. I would argue that 15 years later, since today there are more terrorists, more terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties -- this by the count of the U.S. State Department -- since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history, since the Flood, perhaps, we have not succeeded in our response. Now you have to ask, where did we go wrong? What did we do? What was the mistake that was made? And you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place. There are political food fights. We've turned our discourse into a cage match. And that's true. But there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction, even though I would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do, because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress. But there are other problems. And the other problems came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now, we're in a creativity crisis. In Washington, in think tanks, where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas, you don't get bold new ideas, because if you offer up a bold new idea, not only are you attacked on Twitter, but you will not get confirmed in a government job. Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate, you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality, tiny groups of people making decisions. When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions, what do you get? You get groupthink. Everybody has the same worldview, and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat. That's a danger. You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles. And so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight, that look forward, that do strategy -- the parts in other governments that do this -- can't do it, because they're reacting to the news cycle. And so we're not looking ahead. On 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way. Today we have a crisis because, because of 9/11, we are still looking in the wrong direction, and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on 9/11; far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists; far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today. In fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms. They may be a reaction to bigger trends. And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend, then we've got far bigger problems to deal with. And so what are those trends? Well, to a group like you, the trends are apparent. We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven. If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago -- it said that 80 percent of the people on the planet, by the year 2020, would have a smartphone. They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket. In most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent. We passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards, out in the world than there were people. We are within years of a profound moment in our history, when effectively every single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man-made system for the first time, able to touch anyone else -- touch them for good, touch them for ill. And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about, when they're thinking about these immediate threats. On the security side, we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war, and so we didn't, to a period that I call Cool War, cyber war, where the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop. We may enter a period of constant warfare, and we know this because we've been in it for several years. And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard. We don't have the basic ideas formulated. If someone attacks us with a cyber attack, do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack? We don't know. If somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them? When China launched a series of cyber attacks, what did the U.S. government do? It said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys, who are never coming to America. They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer who's going to take them into custody. It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent. Special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had. In fact, if you've got a cell phone, you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have, and would have highly classified 10 years ago. In my cell phone, I have an app that tells me where every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed, and what kind of aircraft it is, and where it's going and where it's landing. They have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do. They're using these tools in new ways. When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist, he went in with a rifle... and an iPad. And the weapon was the iPad. Because he captured people, he terrorized them, he pointed the iPad at them, and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet, and he took over the world's media. But it doesn't just affect the security side. The relations between great powers -- we thought we were past the bipolar era. We thought we were in a unipolar world, where all the big issues were resolved. Remember? It was the end of history. But we're not. We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet -- that it was going to connect us, weave society together -- are not necessarily true. In countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China. You've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders. We control the content. We are going to control our security. We are going to manage that Internet. We are going to say what can be on it. We're going to set a different set of rules. Now you might think, well, that's just China. But it's not just China. It's China, India, Russia. It's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil. After the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, they said, let's create a new Internet backbone, because we can't be dependent on this other one. And so all of a sudden, what do you have? You have a new bipolar world in which cyber-internationalism, our belief, is challenged by cyber-nationalism, another belief. We are seeing these changes everywhere we look. We are seeing the advent of mobile money. It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect. It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania, where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones. There are 2.5 million people who don't have financial service access that are going to get it soon. A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell phone soon. It's not just going to give them the ability to bank. It's going to change what monetary policy is. It's going to change what money is. Education is changing in the same way. Healthcare is changing in the same way. How government services are delivered is changing in the same way. And yet, in Washington, we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State. We are trying to determine how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago, when in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them. And that gets us to another breakdown that's crucial, and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this, because the growth of America and real American national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War, was a public-private partnership between science, technology and government that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things. But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph; it was radar and the Internet. It was Tang, the breakfast drink -- probably not the most important of those developments. But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue, and the dialogue has broken down. It's broken down because in Washington, less government is considered more. It's broken down because there is, believe it or not, in Washington, a war on science -- despite the fact that in all of human history, every time anyone has waged a war on science, science has won. (Applause) But we have a government that doesn't want to listen, that doesn't have people at the highest levels that understand this. In the nuclear age, when there were people in senior national security jobs, they were expected to speak throw-weight. They were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary. If you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now and said, ""Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience, about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow,"" you'd get a blank stare. I know, because when I wrote this book, I talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side, who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table. Meanwhile, on the tech side, we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things, but they started in garages and they didn't need the government and they don't want the government. Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic: leave me alone. But the world's coming apart. All of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and privacy. And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues, which are philosophical issues. If you can't vote, if you can't have a job, if you can't bank, if you can't get health care, if you can't be educated without Internet access, is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions? If Internet access is a fundamental right, is electricity access for the 1.2 billion who don't have access to electricity a fundamental right? These are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers? Where's the dialogue? And that brings me to the reason that I'm here. I live in Washington. Pity me. (Laughter) The dialogue isn't happening there. These big issues that will change the world, change national security, change economics, create hope, create threats, can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government. Both sides need each other. And until we recreate that connection, until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow, then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable. The risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent. They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together scientists, technologists, government leaders, at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance, akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras that have happened on Earth, and start coming up with, if not the right answers, then at least the right questions. We are not there yet, but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed. And that's why I believe that groups like TED, discussions like this around the planet, are the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy, of social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place. And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you. Thank you very, very much. (Applause)"
13:01,Rich Benjamin,My road trip through the whitest towns in America,Aug 2015,"Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name; a place with splendid vistas; a place where you can drive just 20 minutes and put your sailboat on the water. It's a seductive place, isn't it? I don't live there. (Laughter) But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America. What is a Whitopia? I define Whitopia in three ways: First, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000. Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm, a pleasant look and feel, a je Ne sais quoi. (Laughter) To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia. First stop, St. George -- a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities, who I needed to meet, where I needed to be, and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings, I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor. I rented myself this home by phone. (Laughter) (Applause) Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey, I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week. (Laughter) Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members. I also went fishing. (Laughter) Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return, people invited me to their dinner parties, and to their barbecues, and to their pool parties, and to their birthday parties. But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration, and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real-time preview, and so it has become. Next stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself, also by phone. (Laughter) The book ""A Thousand Places To See Before You Die"" lists Coeur d'Alene -- it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen. My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest, for North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in? I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind, until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been. What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars. About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations, happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. (Laughter) I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. (Laughter) Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... (Laughter) ...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee, and he said, ""Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you."" (Laughter) Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists; in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather, they emigrate there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety -- reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself. Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God. (Laughter) The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston. That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. (Laughter) But what does it all mean? Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls, and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals, social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism -- privatized places, privatized people, privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations -- how we treat each other as human beings -- are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago? What a journey that would have been. (Laughter) And yet, some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970. As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other, to dance with each other, to host with each other, but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities? It's a devastating irony, how we have gone forward as individuals, and backwards as communities. One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying: ""One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50 black men is a ghetto."" One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042. By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority. As such, will there be more Whitopias? In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. I ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing, but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. (Laughter) I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia -- or a Blacktopia, for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. (Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. Thank you. (Applause)"
9:22,Trevor Aaronson,How this FBI strategy is actually creating US-based terrorists,Jun 2015,"The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots in the United States than any other organization. More than al Qaeda, more than al Shabaab, more than the Islamic State, more than all of them combined. This isn't likely how you think about the FBI. You probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger, or arresting corrupt politicians. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the FBI became less concerned   with gangsters and  crooked elected officials. The new target became terrorists, and the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI. Every year, the Bureau spends 3.3 billion dollars on domestic counterterrorism activities. Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars combined for organized crime, financial fraud, public corruption  and all other types of traditional criminal activity. I've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in  the United States, and I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists. In the 14 years since 9/11, you can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States. These include the Boston Marathon  bombings in 2013, as well as failed attacks, such as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. In those same 14 years, the Bureau, however, has bragged about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots. In all, the FBI has arrested more than 175 people in aggressive, undercover  conterterrorism stings. These operations, which are usually led by an informant, provide the means and opportunity, and sometimes even the idea, for mentally ill and  economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists. After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict: never again. Never another attack on American soil. FBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck. To do this, agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide, all looking for anyone who  might be dangerous. An informant can earn  100,000 dollars or more for every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI. That's right, the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the United States, but mostly Muslim American communities. These informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and Walli Mujahidh. Both are mentally ill. Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide. Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder, he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle with weapons provided,  of course, by the FBI. The FBI's informant was Robert Childs, a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid 90,000 dollars  for his work on the case. This isn't an outlier. In 2009, an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx. The lead defendant was James Cromitie, a broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems. And the informant had offered  him 250,000 dollars if he participated in that plot. There are many more examples. Today, The Intercept published my new story about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac, a young man who was living  near Tampa, Florida. Osmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder. He too was broke, and he had no connections to  international terrorist groups. Nonetheless, an FBI informant gave him a job, handed him money, introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist, and lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar. But here's what's interesting: The lead undercover agent -- you can see him in this picture with his face blurred -- would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on. Behind closed doors, FBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical. A federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations. He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this. Behind closed doors, the lead agent, the squad supervisor, described their would-be terrorist as a ""retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in."" They described his terrorist ambitions  as wishy-washy and a pipe dream scenario. But that didn't stop the FBI. They provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed. They gave him a car bomb, they gave him an AK-47, they helped him make a so-called martyrdom video, and they even gave  him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go. As they were working the sting, the squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending. And he got a Hollywood ending. When Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb, he was arrested, convicted and  sentenced to 40 years in prison. Sami Osmakac isn't alone. He's one of more than  175 so-called terrorists, for whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings. U.S. government officials call this the War on Terror. It's really just theater, a national security theater, with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI. Thank you. (Applause) Tom Rielly: So, those are some pretty strong accusations, pretty strong charges. How can you back this up? Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010 when I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program at U.C. Berkeley, and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during  the first decade after 9/11. And we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups, whether an informant was used, and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity. And we submitted that to the FBI and we asked them to respond to our database. If they believed there were any errors, we asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings. Later, I used that data  in a magazine article and later in my book, and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR, they were offered that opportunity again to say, ""Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong."" And they've never come forward and said, ""These are the problems with those findings."" So the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch on its recent report on  these types of sting operations. And so far, the FBI has never  really responded to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists so much as it's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations. TR: So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website, that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald. Tell us about your article  and why there. TA: The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is  really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed based on the government's claim  that their release would irreparably damage  the U.S. government's law enforcement strategy. So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists and publish their work when they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this. So my story in The Intercept,  which was just published today, tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail. In this talk, I could only highlight the things that they said, such as calling him a ""retarded fool."" But it was much more elaborate, they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands, which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent. When he went to trial, the central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons, when in truth, these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke to get money to then  pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for. TR: One final question. Less than 10 days ago, the FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn, saying that they might be headed to Syria, and were those real, or examples of more of the same? TA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file, but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same. These types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor. So initially it was al Qaeda plots, and now the Islamic State is the current flavor. What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot to go to Syria after the introduction of the FBI informant, and in fact, the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed. In kind of a comical turn  in that particular case, one of the defendant's mother had found out that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport. So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport, that he ever could have gone anywhere. So yes, there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State in the United States, and those are people that the United  States government should be looking at to see if they're interested in violence here. In this particular case, given the evidence that's so far come out, it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to Syria when they were never close  to that in the first place. TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing. TA: Thank you. (Applause)"
20:01,Kevin Rudd,Are China and the US doomed to conflict?,Apr 2015,"G'day, my name's Kevin. I'm from Australia. I'm here to help. (Laughter) Tonight, I want to talk about a tale of two cities. One of those cities is called Washington, and the other is called Beijing. Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries, it affects all of us in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of: the air we breathe, the water we drink, the fish we eat, the quality of our oceans, the languages we speak in the future, the jobs we have, the political systems we choose, and, of course, the great questions of war and peace. You see that bloke? He's French. His name is Napoleon. A couple of hundred years ago, he made this extraordinary projection: ""China is a sleeping lion, and when she awakes, the world will shake."" Napoleon got a few things wrong; he got this one absolutely right. Because China is today not just woken up, China has stood up and China is on the march, and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century? You start looking at the numbers, they start to confront you in a big way. It's projected that China will become, by whichever measure -- PPP, market exchange rates -- the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead. They're already the largest trading nation, already the largest exporting nation, already the largest manufacturing nation, and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. America comes second. So if China does become the world's largest economy, think about this: It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England -- George III, not a good friend of Napoleon's -- that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non-English speaking country, a non-Western country, a non-liberal democratic country. And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future, then personally, I think you've been smoking something, and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. So in short, the question we have tonight is, how do we understand this mega-change, which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century? It'll affect so many things. It will go to the absolute core. It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently. It's happening in some senses under the radar, as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East, what's going on with ISIS, what's going on with ISIL, what's happening with the future of our economies. This is a slow and quiet revolution. And with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge, and the mega-challenge is this: Can these two great countries, China and the United States -- China, the Middle Kingdom, and the United States, Měiguó -- which in Chinese, by the way, means ""the beautiful country."" Think about that -- that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years. Whether these two great civilizations, these two great countries, can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world? In short, can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous, or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace? And I have 15 minutes to work through war or peace, which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called ""War and Peace."" People ask me, why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese? Well, there are two reasons for that. Here's the first of them. That's Betsy the cow. Now, Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia. See those hands there? These are not built for farming. So very early on, I discovered that in fact, working in a farm was not designed for me, and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life. Here's the second reason. That's my mom. Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do? Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do? I rarely did, but what my mom said to me was, one day, she handed me a newspaper, a headline which said, here we have a huge change. And that change is China entering the United Nations. 1971, I had just turned 14 years of age, and she handed me this headline. And she said, ""Understand this,  learn this, because it's going to affect your future."" So being a very good student of history, I decided that the best thing for me to do was, in fact, to go off and learn Chinese. The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name. And so they gave me this name: Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer, and Wén, and that's the character for literature or the arts. Kè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics. Any of you guys called ""Kevin""? It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics. (Laughter) I've been called Kevin all my life. Have you been called Kevin all your life? Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics? And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service, but here is where pride -- before pride, there always comes a fall. So there I am in the embassy in Beijing, off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador, who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People. And so there was I. If you've been to a Chinese meeting, it's a giant horseshoe. At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh-bahs, and down the end of the horseshoe are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs, the junior woodchucks like me. And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase. He said, ""China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness."" And I thought to myself, ""That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd. I will improve it."" Note to file: Never do that. It needed to be a little more elegant, a little more classical, so I rendered it as follows. [In Chinese] There was a big pause on the other side of the room. You could see the giant pooh-bahs at the head of the horseshoe, the blood visibly draining from their faces, and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter. Because when I rendered his sentence, ""Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness,"" in fact, what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm. (Laughter) That was the last time I was asked to interpret. But in that little story, there's a wisdom, which is, as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of 5,000 years of continuing history, there's always something new to learn. History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. This guy up here? He's not Chinese and he's not American. He's Greek. His name's Thucydides. He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars. And he made this extraordinary observation  about Athens and Sparta. ""It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable."" And hence, a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap. This guy here? He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese. His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote ""The Art of War,"" and if you see his statement underneath, it's along these lines: ""Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected."" Not looking good so far for China and the United States. This guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison. In fact, he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston. He's working on a single project at the moment, which is, does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China-U.S. relations? It's a core question. And what Graham has done is explore 15 cases in history since the 1500s to establish what the precedents are. And in 11 out of 15 of them, let me tell you, they've ended in catastrophic war. You may say, ""But Kevin -- or Conqueror of the Classics -- that was the past. We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization. It could never happen again."" Guess what? The economic historians tell us that in fact, the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in 1914, just before that happened, World War I, a sobering reflection from history. So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks, feels, and positions itself towards the United States, and the reverse, how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together? Let me first go to, in fact, China's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West. Number one: China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history, beginning with the Opium Wars. When after that, the Western powers carved China up into little pieces, so that by the time it got to the '20s and '30s, signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai. [""No dogs and Chinese allowed""] How would you feel if you were Chinese,   in your own country,  if you saw that sign appear? China also believes and feels as if, in the events of 1919, at the Peace Conference in Paris, when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world, what about German colonies in China? They were, in fact, given to Japan. When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China. And then, on top of that, the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies, and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S. right around its periphery. And beyond all that, the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. That is, we don't recognize the problems in our own system, in our politics and our economics, and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere, and believe that, in fact, we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. Of course, in international relations, it's not just the sound of one hand clapping. There's another country too, and that's called the U.S. So how does the U.S. respond to all of the above? The U.S. has a response to each of those. On the question of is the U.S. containing China, they say, ""No, look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment."" Instead, what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy, and on top of that, welcome them into the World Trade Organization. The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights, and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms. Furthermore, the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights, democracy, and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West. And on top of all the above, what does the United States say? That they fear that China will, when it has sufficient power, establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia, boot the United States out, and in time, when it's powerful enough, unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order. So apart from all of that, it's just fine and dandy, the U.S.-China relationship. No real problems there. The challenge, though, is given those deep-rooted feelings, those deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns, what the Chinese call ""Sīwéi,"" ways of thinking, how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two? I argue simply this: We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose. What do I mean by that? Be realistic about the things that we disagree on, and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them. Be constructive in areas of the bilateral, regional and global engagement between the two, which will make a difference for all of humankind. Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia, an Asia-Pacific community. And worldwide, act further, like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart. Of course, all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above. These things are deliverable. But the question is, are they deliverable alone? This is what our head tells us we need to do, but what about our heart? I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who, frankly, haven't had a whole lot in common in the past. And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples. This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government, the Australian parliament, and for the Australian people. After 200 years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians, it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry. The important thing -- (Applause) The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology. It was extraordinary to see, for example, old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents, like this lady here. It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building, and one woman said to me, it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life, and she was over 70. That's a terrible story. And then I remember this family saying to me, ""You know, we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing, drove our way through redneck country. On the way back, stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake."" And they walked into this cafe quietly, tentatively, gingerly, a little anxious. I think you know what I'm talking about. But the day after the apology, what happened? Everyone in that cafe, every one of the white folks, stood up and applauded. Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia. The white folks, our Aboriginal brothers and sisters, and we haven't solved all these problems together, but let me tell you, there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head, we'd gone also to the heart. So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening, which is the future of U.S.-China relations? The head says there's a way forward. The head says there is a policy framework, there's a common narrative, there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better. But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America-China relationship, and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world. Sometimes, folks, we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. In China, they now talk about the Chinese Dream. In America, we're all familiar with the term ""the American Dream."" I think it's time, across the world, that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind. Because if we do that, we might just change the way that we think about each other. [In Chinese] That's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China. That's my challenge to all of us, but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war. I thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that. It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging. You, in a way, are uniquely placed to speak to both sides. Kevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians do best is organize the drinks, so you get them together in one room, and we suggest this and suggest that, then we go and get the drinks. But no, look, for all of us who are friends of these two great countries, America and China, you can do something. You can make a practical contribution, and for all you good folks here, next time you meet someone from China, sit down and have a conversation. See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think, and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same. Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference. Those of us up the middle, we can make a small contribution. CA: Kevin, all power to you, my friend. Thank you. KR: Thank you. Thank you, folks. (Applause)"
21:38,Dave Isay,Everyone around you has a story the world needs to hear,Mar 2015,"Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life, and in yours. When I was 22 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stories. At almost the exact same time, I found out that my dad, who I was very, very close to, was gay. I was taken completely by surprise. We were a very tight-knit family, and I was crushed. At some point, in one of our strained conversations, my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots. He told me that one night in 1969, a group of young black and Latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan called the Stonewall Inn, and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement. It was an amazing story, and it piqued my interest. So I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more. With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker, we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night. Recording these interviews, I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to. I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing, fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met. It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience. I dedicated the program to my dad, it changed my relationship with him, and it changed my life. Over the next 15 years, I made many more radio documentaries, working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media. Over and over again, I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people, particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter. I could literally see people's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone. In 1998, I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the Bowery in Manhattan. Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades. They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next. Later, I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang. I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page. He stood there staring at it in silence, then he grabbed the book out of my hand and started running down the long, narrow hallway holding it over his head shouting, ""I exist! I exist."" (Applause) In many ways, ""I exist"" became the clarion call for StoryCorps, this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago. The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head. Traditionally, broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people, but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work, and see if we could give many, many, many people the chance to be listened to in this way. So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago, we built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their life. You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside. You sit across from, say, your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk. Many people think of it as, if this was to be our last conversation, what would I want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me? At the end of the session, you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that your great-great-great-grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story. So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being. I had no idea if it would work, but from the very beginning, it did. People treated the experience with incredible respect, and amazing conversations happened inside. I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth. This is 12-year-old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother, Sarah. Josh has Asperger's syndrome. As you may know, kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially. They usually have obsessions. In Josh's case, it's with animals, so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago. (Video) Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10, do you think your life would be different without animals? Sarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals, because they add so much pleasure to life. JL: How else do you think your life would be different without them? SL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes. JL: Well, I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything. SL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person -- JL: But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate. SL: Yeah, it really is. JL: Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child? SL: I remember when you were a baby, you had really bad colic, so you would just cry and cry. JL: What's colic? SL: It's when you get this stomach ache and all you do is scream for, like, four hours. JL: Even louder than Amy does? SL: You were pretty loud, but Amy's was more high-pitched. JL: I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more, like she's the perfect little angel. SL: Well, I can understand why you think that people like Amy more, and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome, but being friendly comes easily to Amy, whereas I think for you it's more difficult, but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much. JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos? SL: Yeah -- JL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity? (Laughter) SL: I wouldn't judge the quality, but I think -- JL: I mean, first it was like, Amy loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia, she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia. SL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey. The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends, and really that's what you need in life. JL: Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born? Did I meet your expectations? SL: You've exceeded my expectations, sweetie, because, sure, you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like, but you have made me grow so much as a parent, because you think -- JL: Well, I was the one who made you a parent. SL: You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point. (Laughter) But also because you think differently from what they tell you in the parenting books, I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you, and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person, and I'll always thank you for that. JL: And that helped when Amy was born? SL: And that helped when Amy was born, but you are so incredibly special to me and I'm so lucky to have you as my son. (Applause) David Isay: After this story ran on public radio, Josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was. His mom, Sarah, bound them together in a book, and when Josh got picked on at school, they would read the letters together. I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight. Sarah Littman and her son Josh, who is now an honors student in college. (Applause) You know, a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories, and it's not because they're sad. Most of them aren't. I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment, when sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advertisement. It's kind of the anti-reality TV. Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich. Nobody comes to get famous. It's simply an act of generosity and love. So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity, and when you hear that kind of story, it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground. So this experiment  in Grand Central worked, and we expanded across the country. Today, more than 100,000 people in all 50 states in thousands of cities and towns across America have recorded StoryCorps interviews. It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered. (Applause) We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience. Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps traveling the country, gathering the wisdom of humanity. They call it bearing witness, and if you ask them, all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good. And I think for the first years of StoryCorps, you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening, but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country -- rich, poor, five years old to 105, 80 different languages, across the political spectrum -- you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something. I've also learned so much from these interviews. I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen, like this interview between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her. (Audio) Danny Perasa: You see, the thing of it is, I always feel guilty when I say ""I love you"" to you. And I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me. It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio, and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house. Annie Perasa: If I don't have a note on the kitchen table, I think there's something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning. DP: Well, the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen. AP: To my princess: The weather outside today is extremely rainy. I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning. DP: It's a romantic weather report. AP: And I love you. I love you. I love you. DP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work, no matter what happens in the rest of the day, there's a shelter when you get home, there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying, ""Get your hands off me."" Being married is like having a color television set. You never want to go back to black and white. (Laughter) DI: Danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth, but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of Hollywood's leading men put together. What else have I learned? I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive. I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength. Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson. When Oshea was a teenager, he murdered Mary's only son, Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight. A dozen years later, Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son's life. Slowly and remarkably, they became friends, and when he was finally released from the penitentiary, Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary. This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed. (Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son is no longer here. I didn't see him graduate, and now you're going to college. I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn't see him get married. Hopefully one day, I'll be able to experience that with you. Oshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation. It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path. You still believe in me, and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you, it's amazing. MJ: I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together, even with us sitting here looking at each other right now. I know it's not an easy thing, so I admire that you can do this. OI: I love you, lady. MJ: I love you too, son. (Applause) DI: And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people, and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice. Like the story of Alexis Martinez, who was born Arthur Martinez in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago. In the interview, she talks with her daughter Lesley about joining a gang as a young man, and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be. This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley. (Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most difficult things for me was I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed to be in my granddaughters' lives, and you blew that completely out of the water, you and your husband. One of the fruits of that is, in my relationship with my granddaughters, they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she. Lesley Martinez: But they're free to talk about it. AM: They're free to talk about it, but that, to me, is a miracle. LM: You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe. We're not going to cut you off, and that's something I've always wanted you to just know, that you're loved. AM: You know, I live this every day now. I walk down the streets as a woman, and I really am at peace with who I am. I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe, but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day. DI: Now I walk in love. I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps. It takes some courage to have these conversations. StoryCorps speaks to our mortality. Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone. There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying. He wrote a book called ""The Four Things That Matter Most"" about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die: thank you, I love you, forgive me, I forgive you. They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another, and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth. It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about -- no regrets, nothing left unsaid. And it's hard and it takes courage, but that's why we're alive, right? So, the TED Prize. When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago about the possibility of the Prize, I was completely floored. They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity, no more than 50 words. So I thought about it, I wrote my 50 words, and a few weeks later, Chris called and said, ""Go for it."" So here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we've learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history. How are we going to do that? With this. We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these, and it has powers I never could have imagined 11 years ago when I started StoryCorps. It has a microphone, it can tell you how to do things, and it can send audio files. Those are the key ingredients. So the first part of the wish is already underway. Over the past couple of months, the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Remember, StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation, which is preserved forever, but at this very moment, we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app. The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the StoryCorps interview process, helps you pick questions, and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview, and then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress. That's the easy part, the technology. The real challenge is up to you: to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world, so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year, we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more. Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving, so that in one single weekend an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured. (Applause) Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people, and in doing so, begin to build bonds of trust; or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview on their 75th birthday; or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are, what they've learned in life, and how they want to be remembered. (Applause) Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist, and became a well-known gay activist. This is the picture of us at that interview. I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients 40 hours a week, was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away very suddenly a few days later. It was June 28, 2012, the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died. I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session. I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings. Every day, people come up to me and say, ""I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long."" Now, no one has to wait anymore. At this moment, when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential, join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important. Help us create this gift to our children, this testament to who we are as human beings. I hope you'll help us make this wish come true. Interview a family member, a friend or even a stranger. Together, we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important. And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"
11:48,Ben Wellington,How we found the worst place to park in New York City — using big data,Feb 2015,"Six thousand miles of road, 600 miles of subway track, 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track, if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City. These are the statistics of our infrastructure. They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies. For example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain. The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are. Most city agencies give us statistics. This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, where we learn that there's about 13,500 taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting, right? But did you ever think about where these numbers came from? Because for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know. Here's a number  that our citizens want to know. So they go back to their raw data, they count, they add, they calculate, and then they put out reports, and those reports will have numbers like this. The problem is, how do they know all of our questions? We have lots of questions. In fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city. The agencies can never keep up. So the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that, because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. In a lot of ways, he's right. In the last two years,  the city has released 1,000 datasets on our open data portal, and it's pretty awesome. So you go and look at data like this, and instead of just counting the number of cabs, we can start to ask different questions. So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City? It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly? And I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers, these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. There's data there, and I looked at that data, and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day. You can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning, speed increases, and at that point, things turn around, and they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning, when they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour. The average taxi is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city streets, and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day. (Laughter) So I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. There's just a rush day. Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons. If you're a transportation planner, this might be pretty interesting to know. But if you want to get somewhere quickly, you now know to set your alarm for 4:45 in the morning and you're all set. New York, right? But there's a story behind this data. This data wasn't just available, it turns out. It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request, or a FOIL Request. This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website. In order to access this data, you need to go get this form, fill it out, and they will notify you, and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that. Chris went down, and they told him, ""Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office, leave it here for five hours, we'll copy the data and you take it back."" And that's where this data came from. Now, Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public, and so it ended up online for all to use, and that's where this graph came from. And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders -- really cool. But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public -- it was already kind of public, you could get to it, but it was ""public,"" it wasn't public. And we can do better than that as a city. We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives. Now, not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request. Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents. So the red areas are more dangerous. And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan, especially in the lower area of Manhattan, has more cyclist accidents. That might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there. But there's other hotspots worth studying. There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero. This is exactly what we're looking for. But there's a story behind this data as well. This data didn't just appear. How many of you guys know this logo? Yeah, I see some shakes. Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it? I see more shakes. More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that. So what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. In fact, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF put out by our very own NYPD, and in order to access it, you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours, or you could be John Krauss. John Krauss was like, I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program. It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid, and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs. Every day it would search; if it found a PDF, it would download it and then it would run some PDF-scraping program, and out would come the text, and it would go on the Internet, and then people could make maps like that. And the fact that the data's here, the fact that we have access to it -- Every accident, by the way, is a row in this table. You can imagine how many PDFs that is. The fact that we have access to that is great, but let's not release it in PDF form, because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers. It's not the best use of our citizens' time, and we as a city can do better than that. Now, the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago, and so now we can actually have access to it, but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF. For example, our crime data is still only available in PDF. And not just our crime data, our own city budget. Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form. And it's not just us that can't analyze it -- our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. So our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for. And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. Now, there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs. This is an example of a map I made, and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City. Now, how do I measure dirty? Well, it's kind of a little weird, but I looked at the level of fecal coliform, which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. The larger the circle, the dirtier the water, so the large circles are dirty water, the small circles are cleaner. What you see is inland waterways. This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years. And inland waterways are, in general, dirtier. That makes sense, right? And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this. Number one: Never swim in anything that ends in ""creek"" or ""canal."" But number two: I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City, by this measure, one measure. In Coney Island Creek, which is not the Coney Island you swim in, luckily. It's on the other side. But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water. And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report, right? It's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov. You're not going to see it there, but the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome. But once again, it wasn't super easy, because this data was not on the open data portal. If you were to go to the open data portal, you'd see just a snippet of it,  a year or a few months. It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website. And each one of these links is an Excel  sheet, and each Excel sheet is different. Every heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize. When you do you can make maps and that's great, but once again, we can do better than that  as a city, we can normalize things. And we're getting there, because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC. This is where 1,100 data sets  that don't suffer from the things I just told you live, and that number is growing, and that's great. You can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document. Whatever you want, you can download the data that way. The problem is, once you do, you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently. So one is street name,  intersection street, street, borough, address, building, building address. So once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal, you're spending time normalizing our address fields. And that's not the best use  of our citizens' time. We can do better than that as a city. We can standardize our addresses, and if we do,  we can get more maps like this. This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City, but not just any fire hydrants. These are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets. (Laughter) So I learned a few things from this map, and I really like this map. Number one, just don't park on the Upper East Side. Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park, you will get a hydrant ticket. Number two, I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City, and they're on the Lower East Side, and they were bringing in over 55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets. And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it, so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension, which is like a seven-foot space to walk on, and then a parking spot. And so these cars came along, and the hydrant -- ""It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"" and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them. They would park there, and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them. And it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket. This is the Google  Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket. So I wrote about this on my blog, on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded, and they said, ""While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location, we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations."" And I thought to myself, typical government response, all right, moved on with my life. But then, a few weeks later, something incredible happened. They repainted the spot, and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data, because think about what happened here. For five years, this spot was being  ticketed, and it was confusing, and then a citizen found something, they told the city, and within a few weeks the problem was fixed. It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog. It's not, it's about being a partner. We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government, and it's not that hard. All we need are a few changes. If you're FOILing data, if you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again, let's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public. And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF, let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data, because that data is coming from somewhere. I don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere, and you can release it with the PDF. And let's adopt and share some open data standards. Let's start with our addresses here in New York City. Let's just start normalizing our addresses. Because New York is a leader in open data. Despite all this, we are absolutely a leader in open data, and if we start normalizing things, and set an open data standard, others will follow. The state will follow, and maybe the federal government, Other countries could follow, and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from 100 countries. It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close. And by the way, who are we empowering with this? Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now, active meetups. There are thousands of people attending these meetups. These people are going after work and on weekends, and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place. Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints around your own home, or around your office. You put in your address, you get local complaints. And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. It's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt. It's policy advocates, it's everyone, it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds. And with some small, incremental changes, we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better, whether it's one dataset, or one parking spot at a time. Thank you. (Applause)"
5:23,Anthony Hazard,The Atlantic slave trade: What too few textbooks told you,Dec 2014,"Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property, deprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms  throughout the world. But one institution stands out for both its global scale and its lasting legacy. The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th to the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans to the Americas. The impact it would leave affected not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories of large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade  began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement  of the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies, sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers  or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved,  but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive  demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed  for centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term  and the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could  be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise  to positions of power. But when white captains came offering  manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants  had little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold  not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors,  or prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched  their own realms, and strengthened them  against neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered  from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand created intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves  became a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms  needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies  across the continent. As for the slaves themselves, they faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched  to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships  bound for the Americas. About 20% of them  would never see land again. Most captains of the day  were tight packers, cramming as many men  as possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation  caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown  overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits  by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters  into their own hands. Many inland Africans  had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away  and returning for more. Afraid of being eaten,  or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide  or starved themselves, believing that in death, their souls would return home. Those who survived  were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised  and curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans  who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery  still affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade had on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves  taken were men, the long-term demographic  effect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally  outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies  it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open  to conquest and colonization. And the increased competition  and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability  that continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed to the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans  who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago  outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds  with their ideals of equality. So they claimed that  Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts  to justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves  and their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade  was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued  long after its abolition."
5:39,Alex Gendler,History vs. Christopher Columbus,Oct 2014,"Many people in the United States and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand in History vs. Christopher Columbus. ""Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to  be at work today?"" <i>Cough</i> ""Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated in many parts of the United States on October 12th, the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away from it completely."" <i>Cough</i> ""What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the second Monday in October so people could get a nice  three-day weekend, but I guess you folks just hate celebrations."" ""Uh, what are we celebrating again?"" ""Come on, Your Honor,  we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he sailed the ocean blue, he found something better than India: a whole new continent."" ""What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't  discover anything. There were already people living here for millennia. And he wasn't even  the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland almost 500 years before."" ""You don't say, so how come we're not all wearing those cow helmets?"" ""Actually, they didn't really  wear those either."" <i>Cough</i> ""Who cares what some Vikings did way back when? Those settlements didn't last, but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers who came after. Without him, none of us  would be here today."" ""And because of him, millions of Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did in the colonies he founded? He took the very first  natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily he could conquer and enslave all of them."" ""Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding and taking captives?"" ""Yes, but tribal warfare  was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90% of the population."" ""Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus so important to you, anyway?"" ""Your Honor, Columbus's voyage  was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe, symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?"" ""And what about the struggles  of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out  and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering?"" ""That's history. You can't judge a guy in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization  across the world was a moral duty."" ""Actually, he was pretty bad, even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into  sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other  colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed  from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary,  Bartolomé de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508, over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in  future generations will believe this?'"" ""Well, I'm not sure I believe  those numbers."" ""Say, aren't there other ways the holiday is celebrated?"" ""In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under different names, such as Día de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also renamed the holiday, as Native American Day or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly."" ""So, why not just change the name if it's such a problem?"" ""Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this serious research? It's not like anyone is actually  celebrating genocide."" ""Traditions change, and the way  we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values."" ""Well, it looks like giving tired judges a day off isn't one of those values, anyway."" Traditions and holidays  are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve. And deciding what these  traditions should mean today is a major part  of putting history on trial."
6:17,Dan Barasch,A park underneath the hustle and bustle of New York City,Sep 2014,"My dream is to build the world's first underground park in New York City. Now, why would someone want to build an underground park, and why in New York City? These three tough little buggers are, on the left, my grandmother, age five, and then her sister and brother, ages 11 and nine. This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States, just about a century ago. And like many immigrants at the time, they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot. What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new, unfamiliar area, but they were also literally building the city. I've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history, and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York. But she would often just shrug it off, tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta, and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about. The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up. I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference, and to somehow make the world more beautiful, more interesting and more just. I just didn't really know how. At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad, so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya. But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown. I took a job with the City of New York, but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy. I even took a job at Google, where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems. But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place. It was in 2009 that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site, which is this. This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan, and it was open between 1908 and 1948, just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area. And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in 1948. Fascinated by this discovery, we begged the authorities to draw us into the space, and we finally got a tour, and this is what we saw. Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice. It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space. It's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city, and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig, and all the details are all still there. It's really pretty remarkable. Now, the site itself is located at the very heart of the Lower East Side, and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city. New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities, and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space. So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public, but also could potentially even be green. Our plan, in a nutshell, is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street, directs it below the city sidewalks, and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that's directed underneath. With this approach, you could take a site that looks like this today and transform it into something that looks like this. In 2011, we first released some of these images, and what was funny was, a lot of people said to us, ""Oh, it kind of looks like the High Line underground."" And so what our nickname ended up becoming, and what ended up sticking, was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born. What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel, and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible. So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project. Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse. Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology. You can see the six solar collectors at the center there. And here's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse. You can see the solar canopy overhead, the light streaming in, and this entirely live green space below. So in the course of just a few weeks, tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit, and since that time, we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world. Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site, and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next 10 years. Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there's really a lack of green space. So what we're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area. And right now, we're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way. Here's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself. So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city, and invite people into this warm underground space. In the middle of winter, when it's absolutely freezing outside, the last place you'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park. The Lowline would really be a four-season space and a respite for the city. So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family's story full circle. If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out, I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have, rediscovering our shared history, and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting, more beautiful and more just. Thanks. (Applause)"
3:23,Kenneth C. Davis,What you might not know about the Declaration of Independence,Jul 2014,"""All men are created equal and they are endowed with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" Not so fast, Mr. Jefferson! These words from the Declaration of Independence, and the facts behind them, are well known. In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today."
3:36,Doug Levinson,What gives a dollar bill its value?,Jun 2014,"If you tried to pay for something with a piece of paper, you might run into some trouble. Unless, of course, the piece of paper was a hundred dollar bill. But what is it that makes that bill so much more interesting and valuable than other pieces of paper? After all, there's not much you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the answer. A hundred dollar bill is printed by the government and designated as official currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What makes a hundred dollar bill valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are around. Throughout history, most currency, including the US dollar, was linked to valuable commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold or silver reserves. But after the US abolished this system in 1971, the dollar became what is known as fiat money, meaning not linked to any external resource but relying instead solely on government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government sets this policy? The Executive, the Legislative, or the Judicial? The surprising answer is: none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set by an independent Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks in major cities around the country. Its board of governors, which is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the direct control of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills wouldn't be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged for goods and services. If the total amount of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods and services are produced, each dollar's value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. While this would stimulate business, it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities, like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages and even more inflation. But deflation would make people want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data to determine how much currency should be in circulation, including previous rates of inflation, international trends, and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth and keep people employed, without letting inflation reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only determines how much that paper in your wallet is worth but also your chances of getting or keeping the job where you earn it."
4:15,Nicki Beaman Griffin,The fight for the right to vote in the United States,Nov 2013,"When the next general election rolls around, who will be eligible to show up at the polls and vote for the President of the United States? It's really pretty simple. If you are at least 18 years old, a citizen of the U.S., and a resident of a state, you can vote, assuming, that is, you are not a felon. Seems about right. After all, the United States prides itself on being a democracy, or a government in which the ultimate authority lies with the citizens of the nation. But it was not always this way. In 1789, George Washington won the electoral college with 100% of the vote, but whose vote was it? Probably not yours. Only 6% of the entire United States population was allowed to vote at all. Voting was a right that only white, male property owners were allowed to exercise. By the 1820s and 1830s, the American population was booming from the east coast into the western frontier. Frontier farmers were resilient, self-reliant, and mostly ineligible to vote because they did not own land. As these new areas of the nation became states, they typically left out the property requirement for voting. Leaders such as Andrew Jackson, the United State's first common man President, promoted what he called universal suffrage. Of course, by universal suffrage, Jackson really meant universal white, male suffrage. All he emphasized was getting rid of the property requirement for voting, not expanding the vote beyond white men. By the 1850s, about 55% of the adult population was eligible to vote in the U.S., much better than 6%, but far from everybody. Then, in 1861, the American Civil War began largely over the issue of slavery and states' rights in the United States. When it was all over, the U.S. ratified the 15th Amendment, which promised that a person's right to vote could not be denied based on race, color, or previous condition as a slave. This meant that black men, newly affirmed as citizens of the U.S., would now be allowed to vote. Of course, laws are far from reality. Despite the promise of the 15th Amendment, intimidation kept African-Americans from exercising their voting rights. States passed laws that limited the rights of African-Americans to vote, including things like literacy tests, which were rigged so that not even literate African-Americans were allowed to pass, and poll taxes. So, despite the 15th Amendment, by 1892, only about 6% of black men in Mississippi were registered to vote. By 1960, it was only 1%. And, of course, women were still totally out of the national voting picture. It wasn't until 1920 that the women's suffrage movement won their 30-year battle, and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote, well, white women. The restrictions on African-Americans, including African-American women, remained. After World War II, many Americans began to question the state of U.S. democracy. How could a nation that fought for freedom and human rights abroad come home and deny suffrage based on race? The modern civil rights movement began in the 1940s with those questions in mind. After years of sacrifice, bloodshed, and pain, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finally eliminating restrictions such as literacy tests and protecting the voting rights promised under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution. Now, any citizen over the age of 21 could vote. All seemed well until the United States went to war. When the Vietnam War called up all men age 18 and over for the draft, many wondered whether it was fair to send men who couldn't vote to war. In 1971, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution made all citizens 18 and older eligible to vote, the last major expansion of voting rights in the United States. Today, the pool of eligible voters in the U.S. is far broader and more inclusive than ever before in U.S. history. But, of course, it's not perfect. There are still active efforts to suppress some groups from voting, and only about 60% of those who can vote do. Now that you know all the hard work that went into securing the right to vote, what do you think? Do enough citizens have the right to vote now? And among those who can vote, why don't more of them do it?"
4:32,Jeff Steers,Who won the space race?,Aug 2013,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects. And by August 1957, the Soviet's successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later. So, the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself, but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city. Not wanting to fall too far behind, President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible. So, on December 6, 1957, excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two seconds later. The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment for the United States. Newspapers printed headlines like, ""Flopnik"" and ""Kaputnik."" And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations. Fortunately, the Army had been working on their own parallel project, The Explorer, which was successfully launched in January 1958, but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up before they were surpassed again as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961. Almost a year passed and several more Soviet astronauts completed their missions before Project Mercury succeeded in making John Glenn the first American in orbit in February 1962. By this time, President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it. The U.S. had to do something first, and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight, he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step on July 20, 1969. With both countries' next turning their attention to orbital space stations, there's no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on. But because of improving relations negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev and U.S. President Nixon, the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation rather than competition. The successful joint mission, known as Apollo-Soyuz, in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crews met, shook hands, and exchanged gifts, marked the end of the space race in 1975. So, in the end, what was the point of this whole space race? Was it just a massive waste of time? Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive, using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere? Well, sure, sort of, but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another. During the space race, funding for research and education, in general, increased dramatically, leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made. Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life, from memory foam in mattresses to freeze-dried food, to LEDs in cancer treatment. And, of course, the satellites that we rely on for our GPS and mobile phone signals would not have been there without the space program. All of which goes to show that the rewards of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people pursuing them can imagine."
3:35,Belinda Stutzman,How is power divided in the United States government?,Apr 2013,"Have you ever wondered who has the authority to make laws or punish people who break them? When we think of power in the United States, we usually think of the President, but he does not act alone. In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason. When the American Revolution ended in 1783, the United States government was in a state of change. The founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king, so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power. When the new constitution was adopted in 1787, the structure of the infant government of the United States called for three separate branches, each with their own powers, and a system of checks and balances. This would ensure that no one branch would ever become too powerful because the other branches would always be able to check the power of the other two. These branches work together to run the country and set guidelines for us all to live by. The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Many people feel that the founding fathers put this branch in the document first because they thought it was the most important. The legislative branch is comprised of 100 U.S. Senators and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives. This is better known as the U.S. Congress. Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch, but it is also responsible for approving federal judges and justices, passing the national budget, and declaring war. Each state gets two Senators and some number of Representatives, depending on how many people live in that state. The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution. The leaders of this branch of government are the President and Vice President, who are responsible for enforcing the laws that Congress sets forth. The President works closely with a group of advisors, known as the Cabinet. These appointed helpers assist the President in making important decisions within their area of expertise, such as defense, the treasury, and homeland security. The executive branch also appoints government officials, commands the armed forces, and meets with leaders of other nations. All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people. In fact, the executive branch employs over 4 million people to get everything done. The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch and is detailed in Article 3. This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land, from the federal district courts to the U.S. Supreme Court. These courts interpret our nation's laws and punish those who break them. The highest court, the Supreme Court, settles disputes among states, hears appeals from state and federal courts, and determines if federal laws are constitutional. There are nine justices on the Supreme Court, and, unlike any other job in our government, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, or for as long as they want to stay. Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry, so it is our duty to know how it works and what authority each branch of government has over its citizens. Besides voting, chances are that some time in your life you'll be called upon to participate in your government, whether it is to serve on a jury, testify in court, or petition your Congress person to pass or defeat an idea for a law. By knowning the branches, who runs them, and how they work together, you can be involved, informed, and intelligent."
18:18,iO Tillett Wright,Fifty shades of gay,Jan 2013,"Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive? Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity? We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name? Where are you from? How old are you? What do you do? Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases? Have you ever been divorced? Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now? What are you into? Who are you into? What gender do you like to sleep with? I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes, though, just the question ""what do you do?"" can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. So here's a disclaimer about me, though, before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s, two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing. Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo. (Laughter) It was an unorthodox upbringing, but as a kid on the streets of New York, you learn how to trust your own instincts, you learn how to go with your own ideas. So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, ""I'm a boy."" I mean, who knows, right? When you're six, maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. So this is me when I was 11. I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called ""Julian Po."" I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See, I was also a child actor, which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity, because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant, and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right? No one is exactly shocked. (Laughter) But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later, when I fell in love with a man, neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment. So four, almost five years ago, Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate, was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time, getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country, between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. If this was a war with two disparate sides, I, by default, fell on team gay, because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy, over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was, a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself, who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear, girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish, girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees, girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people, and I admired their freedom, but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen. I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character? How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else? Were we even a group? What group? And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination? Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was? And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party, so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice, without any lighting, or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. For me, photography is not just about exposing film, it's about exposing the viewer to something new, a place they haven't gone before, but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits, mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight, which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people. (Laughter) So this was a very large undertaking, and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold, and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. (Music) Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. (Music) Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face. (Music) ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."" It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States. [""What does equality mean to you?""] [""Marriage""] [""Freedom""] [""Civil rights""] [""Treat every person as you'd treat yourself""] It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in 29 states, more than half of this country, you can legally be fired just for your sexuality. [""Who is responsible for equality?""] I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer: ""We are all responsible for equality."" So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being. (Music) [""Self evident truths""] [""4,000 faces across America""] (Music) (Applause) iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost 85,000 people watched that video, and then they started emailing us from all over the country, asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces. That video was made in the spring of 2011, and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people. I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas, we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family, you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting: Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them. It presents, not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings, but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few. At some point I realized that my mission to photograph ""gays"" was inherently flawed, because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help, and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. (Laughter) People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness? Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks. Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other, but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as ""Grey."" Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative, because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice, I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. (Laughter) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this: If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here, and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another, there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line? Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far? Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far? Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen? Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people, let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs, and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle, just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing, the right to adopt children, the right to marriage, the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here? Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman? It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things, and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period. Thank you. (Applause)"
3:41,Christina Greer,Gerrymandering: How drawing jagged lines can impact an election,Oct 2012,"Most people have heard the word ""gerrymandering"" once or twice, probably during a presidential election. What exactly is gerrymandering? Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines. It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans, or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats. You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible so they can do things like control the state budget, or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future. So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today, we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts.   Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting. That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts. The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party, the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists. You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?"
12:21,Ed Gavagan,A story about knots and surgeons,Sep 2012,"You know, we wake up in the morning, you get dressed, put on your shoes, you head out into the world. You plan on coming back, getting undressed, going to bed, waking up, doing it again, and that anticipation, that rhythm, helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives, and gives it a measure of predictability. Living in New York City, as I do, it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters, it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck. You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen. And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and, because you choose to go down one side or the other, the rest of your life is changed forever. And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train. I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway. I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book. And I get on the car, and I look, and I notice this couple, college-aged, student-looking kids, a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other, and she's got her leg draped over his knee, and they're doing -- they have this little contraption, and they're tying these knots, and they're doing it with one hand, they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly, and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it. I've never seen anything like this. It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks. And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car, and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches, and — (Laughter) — he looks at them, and then in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them, and he starts to say, ""You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look, if you do this -- "" and he takes the laces out of their hand, and instantly, he starts tying these knots, and even better than they were doing it, remarkably. And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture. (Laughter) So he starts to tell them, and he's like, ""No, this is very important here. You know, when you're needing these knots, it's going to be, you know, everything's going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be -- you're going to have all this information coming at you, there's going to be organs getting in the way, it's going to be slippery, and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand, you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."" And at that moment, when I heard that, I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn. As part of an initiation for three of their members, they had to kill somebody, and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night, and they jumped on me without a word. One of the very lucky things, when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team, so I put my hands up right away, instinctively. The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade, and he went in under my elbow, and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. If you know anything about anatomy, that's not a good thing to get cut, and everything, of course, on the way up, and then — I still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck, and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck, and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out. The other guy was still working on me, collapsing my other lung, and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute. I ran down the street and collapsed, and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming. And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision, so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision, and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent's, and we're racing down this hallway, and I see the lights going, and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that. They don't really go to the usual place that memories go. They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter) So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories. And I get into the trauma room, and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there, and I'd been able to breathe a little more now, because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing, but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher. And I said, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" and — (Laughter) — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody, and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising, raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh, and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me, and I think, ""He looks Bangladeshi,"" — (Laughter) — and I just have those two facts, and I just think, ""This could work somehow."" (Laughter) And then I go out, and they work on me for the rest of the night, and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there while they did their work, and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines, my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had, and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me, which I thought was great, you know, just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter) And I came to in the morning. Out of anesthetic, he had let them know that he wanted to be there, and he had given me about a two percent chance of living. So he was there when I woke up, and it was, waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain. It was that enveloping, and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, and it was my instep, and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb. And I looked up, and he's like, ""Good to see you,"" and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything, and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said, ""You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson, and you're going to need all the strength you can get."" And in those days, my hair was down to my waist, I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried, I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter) But I had three days of life support, and everybody was expecting, due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it, so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop, and — (Laughter) — when I finally pooped, then that somehow, surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line, and, um — (Laughter) — on that day, the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me. He had three or four friends with him, and he does that, and they all look, and there was no infection, and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding, and they're like, ""There's no hematomas, blah blah, look at the color,"" and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm, like, this restored automobile that he's just going, ""Yeah, I did that."" (Laughter) And it was just, it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter) And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. And later on, when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time, I went back to him and I was sort of asking him, you know, what am I gonna do? And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said, ""Kid, I saved your life. Like, now you can do whatever you want, like, you gotta get on with that. It's like I gave you a new car and you're complaining about not finding parking. Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best. But you're alive. That's what it's about."" And then I hear, ""Bing-bong,"" and the subway doors are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids, and I go, I think to myself, ""I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them,"" — (Laughter) — and then I think, ""No, this is the New York City subway, that's going to lead to other things."" (Laughter) And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to. I step off, I'm standing on the platform, and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got, from my umbilical cord, and then around that, is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon, and I think that, that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team, and their training and their skill and, always, a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)"
4:34,Jay Walker,The world's English mania,May 2009,"Let's talk about manias. Let's start with Beatlemania. (Recording of crowd roaring) Hysterical teenagers, crying, screaming, pandemonium. (Recording of crowd roaring) Sports mania: deafening crowds, all for one idea -- get the ball in the net. (Recording) Goal! Okay, religious mania: there's rapture, there's weeping, there's visions. Manias can be good. Manias can be alarming. Or manias can be deadly. (Recording of crowd cheering) The world has a new mania. A mania for learning English. Listen as Chinese students practice their English, by screaming it: Teacher: ... change my life! Students: I want to change my life! T: I don't want to let my parents down! S: I don't want to let my parents down! T: I don't ever want to let my country down! S: I don't ever want to let my country down! T: Most importantly... S: Most importantly... T: I don't want to let myself down! S: I don't want to let myself down! How many people are trying to learn English worldwide? Two billion of them. Students: A t-shirt. A dress. Jay Walker: In Latin America, in India, in Southeast Asia, and most of all, in China. If you're a Chinese student, you start learning English in the third grade, by law. That's why this year, China will become the world's largest English-speaking country. (Laughter) Why English? In a single word: opportunity. Opportunity for a better life, a job, to be able to pay for school, or put better food on the table. Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days. Her score on this one test literally determines her future. She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare. Twenty-five percent of her grade is based on English. It's called the gaokao, and 80 million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test. The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable, unless you witness it. Teacher: Perfect! Students: Perfect! T: Perfect! S: Perfect! T: I want to speak perfect English! S: I want to speak perfect English! T: I want to speak ... S: I want to speak ... T: ... perfect English! S: ... perfect English! T (yelling more loudly): I want to change my life! S (yelling more loudly): I want to change my life! JW: So is English mania good or bad? Is English a tsunami, washing away other languages? Not likely. English is the world's second language. Your native language is your life. But with English you can become part of a wider conversation -- a global conversation about global problems, like climate change or poverty, or hunger or disease. The world has other universal languages. Mathematics is the language of science. Music is the language of emotions. And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving. Not because America is pushing it, but because the world is pulling it. So English mania is a turning point. Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities, or the fall of the Berlin Wall, English represents hope for a better future -- a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
11:11,Ben Katchor,Comics of bygone New York,Apr 2009,"I'm going to read a few strips. These are, most of these are from a monthly page I do in and architecture and design magazine called Metropolis. And the first story is called ""The Faulty Switch."" Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch. It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. But at dusk everything changes. The architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower. And then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them. We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. But the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light, recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. (Laughter) This sound colors our first impression of any room; it can't be helped. But where does this sound, commonly described as a click, come from? Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action? Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment? The often dental consonant of no Indo-European language. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? In the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room. The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter) Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship? Or the recorded crowing of a rooster? Or the distant peel of thunder? Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch? That's the end of that. (Applause) The next story is called ""In Praise of the Taxpayer."" That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom, is cause for celebration. These one or two story structures, designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand, were not meant to be permanent buildings. Yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high-rise construction. Although they make no claim to architectural beauty, they are, in their perfect temporariness, a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place. The most perfect examples occupy corner lots. They offer a pleasant respite from the high-density development around them. A break of light and air, an architectural biding of time. So buried in signage are these structures, that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor: the small commercial building from an earlier century, whose upper floors have been sealed, and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer. The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive, dark green-gray, striated aluminum siding. Take-out sandwich shops, film processing drop-offs, peep-shows and necktie stores. Now these provisional structures have, in some cases, remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime. The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization, a healthy sublimation of the urge to build, and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone. That's the end. (Laughter) And the next story is called, ""On the Human Lap."" For the ancient Egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead -- 30 cubits from foot to knee. It was not until the 14th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple, upholstered in flesh and cloth. Over the next 200 years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap, and then back again. Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways, or leaning against the body. From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy, is but a brief moment in history. You were late for school again this morning. The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. The illusion of speech follows incidentally. What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy? As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. We have fading memories of that provisional temple, erected each time an adult sat down. On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on. It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap, as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels. The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate. I envision a 36-story, 450-unit residential high-rise -- a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. The bathrooms and kitchens will, of course, have no windows. The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood, which we seek, in vain, as adults, to employ. That's the end. (Laughter) The next story is called ""The Haverpiece Collection"" A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway, serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. The profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry. The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date. Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries? Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins. Pears dried in the form of genital organs. Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim. In 1962 the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece, a wealthy prune juice bottler, and consolidated to form the core collection. As an art form it lies somewhere between still-life painting and plumbing. Upon his death in 1967, a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant. (Laughter) Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century Turkish figs for breakfast. (Laughter) The rest of the collection remains here, stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center. A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar. That's the end. Thank you. (Applause)"
24:37,David Rockwell,A memorial at Ground Zero,Jun 2007,"Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground. Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero. Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis. This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her number-one pick. JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. JA: Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember. Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here. This is ours. JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem. Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. JA: But that is about to change. In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there. David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much. JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York. KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic. DR: I like that word. KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing? DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called ""Pleasure,"" which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. KA: Were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs? DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something? DR: Yeah. KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. DR: Well, it's a funny thing. We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? DR: It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city. KA: Shocking. DR: Yeah, surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier 94. We saw how PS 234 worked. The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. KA: On the Hudson River? DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, ""You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather."" So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site. KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project? DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen. KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess? DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said, ""You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."" And we said, ""That's incredible!"" And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? (Laughter) DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, ""I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."" And we said, ""Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."" And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful. KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point? DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember -- a kind of quiet place. So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer -- as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement, up by Saint Paul's and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view. But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before -- a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of ""Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"" sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing? To think of it as this purely temporary installation? DR: No, I don't think so. I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration -- I think this reinforces how important that is. And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there. And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done? DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. KA: But it had some really terrible ideas. DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. KA: Well, I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining -- a silver lining, here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not? DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities. And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? DR: Right, which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses. KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping? DR: Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things. KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform? DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with. DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. KA: As you say, it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial? Those kinds of forms? DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City, which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left. KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence. DR: It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here."
23:05,Anna Deavere Smith,Four American characters,Feb 2007,"So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl, ""If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."" And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder -- thank God for technology -- to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words -- which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform -- if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America. I was also inspired by Walt Whitman, who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him. So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now, and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man? So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history. You know, he was ""born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."" (Laughter) So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history. ""Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one; you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one -- I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment. The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things. You see, we also have the technology. I say, less and less the human touch. ""Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit. The Atlanta airport is a modern airport, and they should leave the gate there. These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination. And these trains are smooth, and they're quiet and they're efficient. And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice. You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans. Now we have humans imitating robots. So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln. Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice. Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors. And that voice, without losing a beat, says, 'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.' Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking. Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- I do that to steel my nerves -- and so I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my -- 'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see. Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train. Silence. And so suddenly they're looking at me. So here I am with the couple, the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know. ""Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother. I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion. So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby, holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof, I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam, what is your considered opinion of the human species?' And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly, starts laughing, starts busting out with this crazy little laugh. I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.' ""But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth. You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain -- you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him. We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course. I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous. Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did? You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling, but there's something in him. And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see. And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see. And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them, and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh -- that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm. Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal; he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim. 'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off. And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh, I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?' ""But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of, you see, all been buried; it's all been buried. So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. So you ask about a defining moment -- ain't no defining moment in American history for me. It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now, where trivia becomes news. And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other. Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not, but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says, 'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."" And that's Studs Terkel. (Applause) So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes. You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people. But since this was called ""risk taking,"" I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk, at a conference like this, as a good thing. But there are certain other connotations to the word ""risk,"" and the same thing about the word ""nature."" What is nature? Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy -- great, big philosophy kind of an organization -- I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know. And she said, ""Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university. And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."" And she said, ""And then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination. And September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate."" So this piece is about a negative imagination. It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is, and about what a risk can be. And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women. Everything I do is word for word off a tape. And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems, and this is called ""A Mirror to Her Mouth."" And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins. ""I began to learn how to cover it up, because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home. I want everybody to think we were a normal family. I mean we had all the materialistic things, but that didn't make my children pain any less; that didn't make their fears subside. I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses. And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare. And I failed them dramatically, because I allowed it to go on and on and on. ""But the night that Myesha got killed -- and the intensity just grew and grew and grew, until one night we came home from getting drugs, and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her, and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt. He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason. I'm just talking about the particular night that she died. And so he put her in the bathtub, and I was in the bedroom with the baby. ""And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died, I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane -- thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone. And it didn't work, didn't work. And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic, who was four months old when I came to jail. ""And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall. And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly. I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move. I didn't even go and see what was happening. I just sat there and listened. And then he put her in the hallway. He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. And then he told her, get up. And when she got up, she says she couldn't see. Her face was bruised. She had a black eye. All around her head was just swollen; her head was about two sizes of its own size. I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep. ""The next morning she was dead. He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited. He says, 'She won't breathe.' I knew immediately that she was dead. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth. He said, he said, he said, 'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.' He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree. ""I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her, that she was missing. We told a security guard that she was missing, though she wasn't missing. And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her. ""And then we got the baby and my other child, and we drove out to, like, I-95. I was so petrified and so numb, all I could look was in the rear-view mirror. And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. My own child, I let that happen to."" So that's an investigation of the negative imagination. (Applause) When I started this project called ""On the Road: A Search For an American Character"" with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers, drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations, because my first big show was a show about a race riot. And so I went to both -- two race riots, one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that. Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece. It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have. Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King. It was captured on videotape -- technology -- and it was played all over the world. Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail. They did not, so there were riots. And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial, ordered by George Bush, Sr. And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial. And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way. So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans, whose stores had been burned to the ground. And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han, I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race. And she asks also a question that Studs talks about: this notion of the ""official truth,"" to question the ""official truth."" So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society. And this is called, ""Swallowing the Bitterness."" ""I used to believe America was the best. I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie. I never saw any poor man, any black. Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do; I don't deny that because I am a victim. But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil, and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems, I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing. Why? Why do we have to be left out? We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR, no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive. We didn't get any because we have a car and a house. And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice? ""OK. OK? OK. OK. Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial. I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict, and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated, all of South Central, all the churches. And they say, 'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.' Well, what about victims' rights? They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King. He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson. He is the model of non-violence, non-violence -- and they would all like to be in his spirit. ""But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people. And I wonder if that is really justice for them, to get their rights in that way. I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them. They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them. I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK. Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. They fought for their rights for over two centuries, and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities, Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream. That's why I understand; that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict. ""But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment. I wish that I could live together with black people. But after the riot, it's too much difference. The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear]. Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire. It's still there; it can burst out anytime."" Mrs. Young-Soon Han. (Applause) The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody, walking really in somebody else's shoes. And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations. Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago. And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded. And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention. He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway -- so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams, and this is on toughness, in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this. And this is called ""Toughness."" ""Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene, her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser? It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know. But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney, I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser. I think that's good luck. (Laughter) ""And, I mean, funny things like this happen. I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan, and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002. It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you've got to be around positive people. I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking; she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.' ""And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. She said, 'Look who she is. You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' (Laughter) And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college, and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything. I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours. You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know, like, you know, she wanted me to talk, I don't think she would even come out here.' ""Confidence? Well, I think I ride more out of determination than confidence. I mean, confidence is like, you know, you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him. I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way. But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form, get the horn.' (Laughter) That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.' I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy, he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing. Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull, even if you're riding upside down. Determination's like, you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt. ""Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo. ""Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is. Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. I mean, look how we are, the roughy family, palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me. It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas. We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together and we sleep together. I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright. I mean, I have my ranch and everything, but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes. I mean, I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died. ""Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a -- you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital. And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out. And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night, so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia, or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up. And then they had to straighten out my nose, and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head, and everybody said that it should have killed me, but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. (Laughter) But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out, I could breathe, and I hadn't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."" Thank you. (Applause)"
